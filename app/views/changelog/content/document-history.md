## User story
**As a** publisher   
**I want** to see the history of a document   
**So that** I can see what has changed and why it has changed over time   

## What do we need to do and why
The history events in Whitehall and Content Publisher vary slightly - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I7TbA9glyFyhyWq5wQJAGykkXFwOJjyd--kLCycXbSY/edit#gid=0

We want to indicate when a document was imported into Content Publisher so that publishers can understand any variations in how the history events are presented.

See design attached.
