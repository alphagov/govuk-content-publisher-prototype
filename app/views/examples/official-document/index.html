          <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">
            Example 1
          </h1>

          <p class="govuk-body">Parliamentary session is represented as a dropdown.</p>

          <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">
            Example 2
          </h1>

          <p class="govuk-body">Parliamentary session is represented as a text input. This relies on users understanding the format of a session nummber (YYYY-YY) and they input the correct information. Validation is more complex. We cannot guarantee accuracy of the data, only the syntax.</p>

            Example 3
          </h1>

          <p class="govuk-body">House of Commons paper number is prefixed with ‘HC’. Parliamentary session is represented as two text inputs separated by a hyphen.</p>

            Example 4
          </h1>

          <p class="govuk-body">Similar to example 3. Parliamentary session is represented as two text inputs separated by the word ‘to’. The user is expected to enter the full year.</p>
