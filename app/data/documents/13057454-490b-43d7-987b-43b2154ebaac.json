We need to remove the barriers that stop people with disabilities or health conditions from reaching their full potential – these steps will help us achieve that.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Businesses will also benefit from being able to retain talent, and build workplaces that support the physical and mental health needs of their employees.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While government can help create the right conditions, employers are best placed to take the small actions that help disabled people and those with health conditions to remain in work.</p>\n\n<p>Evidence shows that early intervention by an employer is important in reducing the number of people leaving the workforce for health reasons. Employers can use simple, low-cost measures such as making flexible adjustments to someone’s working pattern or keeping in touch with people while they are on sick leave.</p>\n\n<p>CBI Chief UK Policy Director Matthew Fell said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Managing sickness absence effectively and reducing it through proactive health and wellbeing initiatives and policies makes good business sense. Where this helps disabled people to contribute their best at work it can also be an important part of employers’ diversity and inclusion efforts.</p>\n\n  <p>With the UK’s productivity performance under the spotlight, many employers know that a well-thought-out health and wellbeing strategy can help boost performance and make their company a better place to work.</p>\n\n  <p>Adding greater flexibility to statutory sick pay so it supports mental as well as physical health makes sense and reflects the reality that 1 in 4 people will experience such an illness each year.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Firms look forward to working with government to develop health and wellbeing approaches that work for business and for employees.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Prerana Issar, Chief People Officer, NHS England said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Helping people manage their health while at work through common sense measures like sickness absence management and occupational health services, is good for employees, better for employers and ultimately supports both the NHS and the economy.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Today’s consultation is an important step in helping businesses to support their workers’ health and wellbeing, and while the NHS will continue to help people when they need it through our Long Term Plan, we will be able to do even more with strong backing from employers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The consultation will also look at how to improve the capacity, value and quality of occupational health services and consider how to reduce the high costs, particularly for smaller employers.</p>\n\n<p>The government wants to ensure all employers can access good advice and support so they understand and are able to act on their responsibilities to employees.</p>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p>Read the consultation <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/health-is-everyones-business-proposals-to-reduce-ill-health-related-job-loss\">Health is everyone’s business: proposals to reduce ill health-related job loss</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press Office</h2>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release – 020 3267 5126</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow DWP on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-07-15T11:57:25.887Z"}]},"document_status":"submitted_for_review","created_by":"John Gill","last_updated_by":"Dave MacLeod","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
