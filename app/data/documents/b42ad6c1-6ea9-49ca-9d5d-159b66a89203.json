reveals the number of first time buyers has hit the highest monthly total since August 2007</li>\n  <li>New Government research shows 87% of public would prefer to buy rather than rent</li>\n  <li>Public also remains supportive of house building in their areas to help address housing shortage</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p>The Housing Minister has hailed the latest mortgage data published today (15 October 2019), which has revealed the number of first-time buyers getting a mortgage, and a foot on the property ladder, increasing to 35,010.</p>\n\n<p>Representing the highest monthly total since August 2007, the figures show an unrelenting demand for home ownership from people who want to call a home their own.</p>\n\n<p>The figures from UK Finance follow the Ministry of Housing’s own research revealing 87% of the public would prefer to buy, rather than rent, a home.</p>\n\n<p>It also found 57% of people support the building of new homes in their own community, up from 28% in 2010 – demonstrating a majority of the public remains pragmatic about how the shortage of new homes is addressed.</p>\n\n<p>Housing Minister Rt Hon Esther McVey MP said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s welcome news that first-time buyers have reached a 12-year high.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">This government is determined to open up the dream of home ownership - with more houses completed last year than in all but one of the last 31 years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"further-information\">Further information</h2>\n\n<p>In August 2019 there were 35,010 first-time buyer mortgages completed. The previous high was in August 2007 when there were 35,070 new first-time buyer mortgages completed.</p>\n\n<p>The government is supporting the delivery of new homes across all tenure types - whether that’s council, social, private, to rent or buy - to ensure everyone’s needs are met.</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_c1f13fd8-9feb-4028-9323-7cb3383323b4\" class=\"contact\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Media enquiries</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n        <p class=\"email\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Email</span>\n          <a href=\"mailto:newsdesk@communities.gov.uk\" class=\"email\">newsdesk@communities.gov.uk</a>\n        </p>\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Please use this number if you are a journalist wishing to speak to Press Office</span>\n          0303 444 1209\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"contact_bfc00333-a9ee-4ca1-9d3c-432dbcdf4640\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Office address and general enquiries</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">2 Marsham Street\n<br>\nLondon</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1P 4DF</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n        <p class=\"contact_form_url\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Contact form</span>\n          <a href=\"https://forms.communities.gov.uk/\">https://forms.communit...</a>\n        </p>\n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">General enquiries:  please use this number if you are a member of the public</span>\n          030 3444 0000\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"contact_f375ee5c-c7f3-4e09-9ba8-2ca0308481c5\" class=\"contact\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Social media - MHCLG</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n    \n    \n      <p class=\"comments\">Twitter - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mhclg\">https://twitter.com/mhclg</a><br>Flickr - <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mhclg\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/mhclg</a><br>LinkedIn - <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/company/mhclg\">http://www.linkedin.com/company/mhclg</a></p>\n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5da5e88ced915d17bac1248c/homeowners-new-960x640.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5da5e88c40f0b631f148428f/homeowners-new-960x640.jpg","alt_text":"Photo of new home buyers moving in","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-10-15T15:55:20.195Z"}]},"document_status":"draft","created_by":"Beth Rodden","last_updated_by":"Dan Osman","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
