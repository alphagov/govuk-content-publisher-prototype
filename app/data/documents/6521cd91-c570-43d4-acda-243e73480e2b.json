guide 8 has been updated to make it clearer what wording is acceptable where deeds are executed by corporate bodies.","details":{"body":"<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/execution-of-deeds-by-corporate-bodies\">In June 2019</a>, we updated practice guide 8 to make it clearer what wording is acceptable where deeds are executed by corporate bodies.</p>\n\n<p>Companies and limited liability partnerships need to use the correct wording when executing deeds from 20 September 2019.</p>\n\n<p>We would like to remind you that from this date we will no longer accept ‘signed as a deed’ as an acceptable form of wording, in prescribed form deeds. Where a disposal is in a prescribed form that must be executed as a deed (such as form TR1 or CH1), we will require that the forms of execution set out in Schedule 9 of the Land Registration Rules 2003 are used.</p>\n\n<p>We ask that you adopt the wording set out in Schedule 9 of the Land Registration Rules 2003 for prescribed deeds. We recommend use for non-prescribed deeds where possible. We believe doing so will help avoid requests for information (requisitions) and improve consistency.</p>\n\n<p>For more information watch our recorded webinars:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gotostage.com/channel/2c2b67c56c2b4603acac3b460bd42695/recording/d822907bb6504e90add04e1cd4ac379f/watch?source=CHANNEL\">Execution of deeds by companies - bitesize</a> offers examples of correct and incorrect execution by corporate bodies (14-minutes)</li>\n  <li>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gotostage.com/channel/2c2b67c56c2b4603acac3b460bd42695/recording/a1c810547d494c5483ce439843cf789f/watch?source=CHANNEL\">Execution of deeds by companies</a> provides more general information about execution requirements (31-minutes)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We know this issue has caused some confusion in the past.
