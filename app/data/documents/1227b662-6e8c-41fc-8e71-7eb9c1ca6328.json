<li>Community groups invited to bid for share of £500,000 to commemorate enormous contribution of the Windrush Generation and their descendants.</li>\n  <li>Councils can receive up to £25,000 to host events and activities on Windrush Day 2020.</li>\n  <li>Announcement follows successful first-ever national Windrush Day earlier this year.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p>Communities across the country can bid for a share of £500,000 funding to celebrate the outstanding contribution of the Windrush Generation and their descendants to the nation’s social, economic, political and religious life.</p>\n\n<p>The annual Grant Scheme will open today (17 October 2019) as communities around the country celebrate Black History Month. The fund will provide up to £25,000 to local councils, charities and community groups seeking to host events for Windrush Day 2020.</p>\n\n<p>The grant scheme supported 50 groups across the country celebrate the inaugural national Windrush Day earlier this year with events including educational workshops, cricket matches, street parties and historical exhibitions.</p>\n\n<p>Communities Secretary,  Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first national Windrush Day earlier this year saw communities across the country celebrate and honour the lasting impact of the Windrush Generation and their descendants.</p>\n\n  <p>Today we are opening applications for funding for Windrush Day 2020 to ensure that we continue to commemorate a seminal moment in Britain’s history for generations to come.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\"> Windrush Day 2020 promises to be bigger, better and bolder. Applications open today and I encourage communities around the country to get involved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Communities Minister Lord Younger said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After the huge success of the first national Windrush Day, I am delighted to confirm that applications for funding for Windrush Day 2020 are now open.</p>\n\n  <p>It is vitally important to keep telling the stories of the courageous Windrush pioneers and their descendants, who have helped to shape our shared history and heritage. We are committed to supporting communities to celebrate their legacy, be it through workshops or music, exhibitions, tournaments or more.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">I encourage communities from across the country to get involved and I look forward to seeing creative and inspiring proposals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Dr Joe Aldred, Churches Together in England, Windrush Day Advisory Panel Member said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Following the amazing national service of thanksgiving in a packed Westminster Abbey on 22 June 2018, and the first official national Windrush Day on 22 June earlier this year, I am looking forward to an even greater Windrush Day 2020.  </p>\n\n  <p>It has been a pleasure to serve with colleagues on the Windrush Day Advisory Panel where I have seen first-hand the commitment of so many to ensuring the contributions of the Windrush Generation to the life of our country is properly recognised.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Giving honour to whom honour is due, is a sound biblical principle and Windrush Day is a significant way to do so by celebrating, commemorating and educating together, absorbing the historic and continuing warmth of Caribbean presence in Britain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This year saw the first national Windrush Day take place, with activities and events taking place up and down the country. Through educational workshops, theatre performances and historical exhibitions communities honoured that landmark day over 70 years ago when the Empire Windrush arrived at Tilbury Docks.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"further-information\">Further information</h2>\n\n<p>The grant scheme is overseen by the Windrush Day Advisory Panel made up of community representatives.</p>\n\n<p>The Advisory Panel will consider how best to celebrate Windrush Day each year. Made up of community representatives from locations around the country, the Panel provides advice directly to government. It will ensure that winning bids are appropriate and resonate with Caribbean communities.</p>\n\n<p>Next month the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government will be hosting workshops around the country to support groups during the grant application process.
