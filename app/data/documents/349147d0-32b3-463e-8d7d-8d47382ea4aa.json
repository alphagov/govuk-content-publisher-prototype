UK provides further support as the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo reaches the one-year mark.","details":{"body":"<p>The  <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-public-health-rapid-support-team-uk-phrst\">UK Public Health Rapid Support Team (<abbr title=\"UK Public Health Rapid Support Team\">UK-PHRST</abbr>)</a> is deploying more public health specialists to the Democratic Republic of Congo (<abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of Congo\">DRC</abbr>), as the country’s Ebola outbreak reaches the one-year mark.</p>\n\n<p>Those being sent to support the <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of Congo\">DRC</abbr> government’s existing efforts include a data scientist, an epidemiologist (an expert in tracking outbreaks) and an infection and prevention control expert, who will work with local scientists.</p>\n\n<p>The deployment is at the request of the World Health Organization’s (<abbr title=\"World Health Organization\">WHO</abbr>) Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (<abbr title=\"Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network\">GOARN</abbr>), following the recent decision to declare the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (<abbr title=\"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\">PHEIC</abbr>).</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"UK Public Health Rapid Support Team\">UK-PHRST</abbr> has worked closely with the <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of Congo\">DRC</abbr> government, <abbr title=\"World Health Organization\">WHO</abbr> and other partners to scale up its response since August 2018, when the current outbreak started. Since that time, there have also been confirmed cases in neighbouring Uganda.</p>\n\n<p>The team’s work is vital to help track the spread of disease, and inform the best approaches to tackling it.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"UK Public Health Rapid Support Team\">UK-PHRST</abbr> can rapidly deploy public health experts within a 48 hour window, to strengthen a country’s response to outbreaks, which helps to stop the spread of disease and save lives.</p>\n\n<p>Since it was established in 2016, the <abbr title=\"UK Public Health Rapid Support Team\">UK-PHRST</abbr> has responded to 10 global outbreaks, including Lassa fever in Nigeria, diphtheria in the displaced Rohingya population in Bangladesh, and pneumonic and bubonic plague in Madagascar.</p>\n\n<p>Professor Daniel Bausch, Director of the <abbr title=\"UK Public Health Rapid Support Team\">UK-PHRST</abbr> said:</p>\n\n<p>“The Congolese people continue to show great resilience in the face of this outbreak.</p>\n\n<p>“However, this is the worst Ebola outbreak in its history and its effects are devastating, with hundreds of lives lost.</p>\n\n<p>“We are assisting the <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of Congo\">DRC</abbr> government to help them build on their response, and will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide all the technical support we can.”</p>\n\n<p>Alok Sharma, Secretary of State for International Development said:</p>\n\n<p>“Ebola has already taken far too many lives in the <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of Congo\">DRC</abbr>. Shockingly it has wiped out entire families and, a year after this outbreak started, it is showing no sign of slowing down.</p>\n\n<p>“The UK has led the way in tackling this killer disease and we can be proud of our support to create a life-saving Ebola vaccine which has inoculated 180,000 people so far. Today’s announcement that more UK health experts will be deployed to the <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of Congo\">DRC</abbr> shows our strong, ongoing commitment to contain the outbreak.</p>\n\n<p>“Diseases like Ebola have no respect for borders. This could spread beyond <abbr title=\"Democratic Republic of Congo\">DRC</abbr>. It is essential the rest of the international community steps up to help. If we don’t act now, many thousands more lives could be lost.”</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"UK Public Health Rapid Support Team\">UK-PHRST</abbr> is a collaborative effort led by Public Health England (<abbr title=\"Public Health England\">PHE</abbr>) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (<abbr title=\"London School of Hygeine and Tropical Medicine\">LSHTM</abbr>), funded by UK Aid from the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title=\"Department of Health and Social Care\">DHSC</abbr>).</p>\n\n<p>It continually monitors infectious diseases and other hazards globally, identifying situations where specialist expertise could prevent these threats from turning into global outbreaks.</p>\n\n<p>The team also conducts innovative research to improve epidemic preparedness and response, and supports countries to build national capacity to respond to outbreaks.</p>\n\n<p>The public health risk to the UK regarding the current Ebola outbreak remains negligible to very low.</p>\n\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d419c59ed915d09db854eee/drc_0471.JPG","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d419c58e5274a0a0a357bba/drc_0471.JPG","alt_text":"Landscape in the Democratic Republic of Congo","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-07-31T15:09:31.346Z"}]},"document_status":"published_but_needs_2i","created_by":"Margo Hayes","last_updated_by":"Nungshi Malik","political":false,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
