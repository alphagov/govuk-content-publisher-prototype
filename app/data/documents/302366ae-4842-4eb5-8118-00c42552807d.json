The High Court ruling endorsed the government’s methodology for the complex process of restoring equality to <abbr title=\"Guaranteed Minimum Pension\">GMP</abbr> schemes.</p>\n\n<p>Minister for Pension and Financial Inclusion, Guy Opperman said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This vital guidance will provide pension trustees with the detailed road map they need to navigate this complicated equalisation process, ensuring they can meet their legal obligations.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">I am determined to ensure that pensions are fair for everyone and this guidance will help achieve this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A <abbr title=\"Guaranteed Minimum Pension\">GMP</abbr> is the minimum pension that an occupational pension scheme, contracted out of the Additional State Pension between 6 April 1978 and 5 April 1997 on a salary-related basis, has to provide to its members. <abbr title=\"Guaranteed Minimum Pensions\">GMPs</abbr> were abolished for contracted out service after 5 April 1997.</p>\n\n<p>There is no single method by which schemes can equalise benefits for the effect of <abbr title=\"Guaranteed Minimum Pensions\">GMPs</abbr>. It is for the trustees of each scheme to decide the methodology that is most appropriate for their scheme.</p>\n\n<p>Read the guidance on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/equalising-pensions-for-the-effect-of-unequal-guaranteed-minimum-pensions\">equalising pension for the effect of unequal Guaranteed Minimum Pensions</a></p>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release – 020 3267 5144</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow DWP on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-04-18T11:14:58.884Z"}]},"document_status":"published","created_by":"Beth Rodden","last_updated_by":"Steph Davis","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true}}
