groundbreaking training partnership to help jobcentre staff better support Universal Credit claimants who are blind or have visual impairments launches today.","details":{"body":"\n<p>From 23 September 2019 all Jobcentre Plus (<abbr title=\"Jobcentre Plus\">JCP</abbr>) staff will be able to access new training through an online portal, which offers information and advice to better support people with sight loss to find a job that’s right for them.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> has worked with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (<abbr title=\"Royal National Institute of Blind People\">RNIB</abbr>) to establish the scheme.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, some jobcentres will also be kitted out with virtual reality headsets designed by <abbr title=\"Royal National Institute of Blind People\">RNIB</abbr>, that when used with an <abbr title=\"Royal National Institute of Blind People\">RNIB</abbr> app mean <abbr title=\"Jobcentre Plus\">JCP</abbr> staff can experience what it feels like to have sight loss.</p>\n\n<p>Minister for Disabled People Justin Tomlinson said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sight loss affects two million people in the UK, so it’s vital that our staff understand the specific challenges visually impaired people can face when seeking work.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">That’s why we’ve collaborated with <abbr title=\"Royal National Institute of Blind People\">RNIB</abbr> to create learning that will help our staff better support visually impaired people to move into and thrive in work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Dr Chrissie Pepper, <abbr title=\"Royal National Institute of Blind People\">RNIB</abbr> Policy Manager said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We are pleased to have worked with <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> to provide sight loss awareness training for jobcentre staff, as a first step towards tackling the difficulties that some blind and partially sighted people face when accessing benefits. We hope this training will lead to a better understanding from <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> and its staff about sight loss and the impact it has, leading to cases being resolved more quickly so that people can access their benefits.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">We look forward to building on this by providing more in-depth training to key <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> staff, such as Disability Employment Advisors, to secure further improvements to <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr>’s services for blind and partially sighted people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Launched to coincide with National Eye Health Week (23 to 29 September 2019), the interactive training modules will help staff to understand sight loss and the effect that it can have on claimants’ lives.</p>\n\n<p>The training looks at the causes of sight loss, barriers faced by those with first-hand experience of visual impairment and the best ways to support people through their Universal Credit journey.</p>\n\n<p>It also offers practical advice around guiding people with sight loss.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the adjustments made to support claimants with sight loss include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>longer appointments</li>\n  <li>tailored support when accessing the internet and completing forms</li>\n  <li>home visits for people unable to access the jobcentre</li>\n  <li>additional support through the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/work-health-programme\">Work and Health</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work\">Access to Work</a> programmes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To mark the launch <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> staff held an event in London attended by staff from <abbr title=\"Royal National Institute of Blind People\">RNIB</abbr>, to showcase the training and give staff the opportunity to experience the virtual reality headsets.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press Office</h2>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release – 020 3267 5144</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-09-26T08:24:08.317Z"}]},"document_status":"published","created_by":"Dan Osman","last_updated_by":"Alex Honnold","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
