Environment Agency and Derbyshire County Council will undertake repairs to help keep people and homes safe.","details":{"body":"<p>Work to fix a damaged section of a culvert which carries the Hogshaw Brook in Buxton is expected to start on Tuesday 27 August 2019.</p>\n\n<p>The Environment Agency and Derbyshire County Council have been working in partnership to identify a solution to repair the damage to the culvert, which was discovered after recent heavy rain and flooding in the area.</p>\n\n<p>The culvert runs beneath properties in the Lightwood Road area and is owned by a number of different private landowners.</p>\n\n<p>But, as funding to resolve the problem through the usual channels could take some time to arrange, the Environment Agency and Derbyshire County Council have agreed to carry out the repairs and jointly cover the costs in the interests of public safety. This will ensure the repairs can be completed as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n<p>A spokesperson from the Environment Agency said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">We have been working closely with Derbyshire County Council to find a suitable repair for the damaged area of the culvert and have agreed the funding to enable it to go ahead quickly. We are confident that the works will restore the culvert to a safe condition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Councillor Simon Spencer, Derbyshire County Council’s Cabinet Member for Highways Transport and Infrastructure, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">We understand this has been distressing for residents so we’re pleased we’ve been able to work closely with the Environment Agency to appoint a contractor to repair the culvert at the earliest opportunity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Derbyshire County Council is now progressing plans for the repair with their contractors and the Environment Agency will continue to provide assistance as needed.</p>\n\n<p>Following completion of the repair, the Environment Agency will continue to work in partnership with Derbyshire County Council to identify potential sources of funding for a wider study of the area to look at how flood risk can be further reduced for the future.</p>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p>To check whether you’re at risk of flooding and to sign up for free flood warnings, visit the Environment Agency’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/flood\">flood warning service </a> online or call 0345 988 1188.</p>\n</div>\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-08-22T11:09:19.303Z"}]},"document_status":"draft","created_by":"Jyoti Raju","last_updated_by":"Dave Graham","political":false,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
