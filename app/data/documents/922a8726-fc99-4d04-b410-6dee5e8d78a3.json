extra month to claim back childcare costs could mean parents avoid missing out on up to £1,100 per month.","details":{"body":"<p>Working parents and guardians will be given weeks of extra time to apply to be reimbursed for their childcare costs, the government announced today.</p>\n\n<p>The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr>) today revealed that those who claim the childcare element of Universal Credit will have an additional month to report their costs.</p>\n\n<p>Up to 85% of childcare costs can be reimbursed through Universal Credit. Previously those reporting costs had to do so in the same month-long Universal Credit assessment period in which they were incurred.</p>\n\n<p>This extension for reporting costs provides parents with more flexibility and could help claimants with 2 or more children avoid losing out on more than £1,100 per month.</p>\n\n<p>Minister for Employment Mims Davies said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sometimes there just aren’t enough hours in the day to get everything done, and that’s before something unexpected happens like a trip to the hospital or having to stay late at work.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">We are determined to support families to balance work-life and parenthood. Allowing an extra month-long assessment period for people to report their childcare costs means people shouldn’t have to worry about missing out on crucial payments they are entitled to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Costs can be reported online, and those in work while in receipt of Universal Credit can apply for up to £646.35 per month if they have one child and up to £1,108.40 for 2 or more children.</p>\n\n<p>The support can be claimed in the month prior to starting work if a person has accepted a job offer.</p>\n\n<p>This improvement follows a number of changes to Universal Credit which aim to make the system simpler and more beneficial than ever before.</p>\n\n<p>Up to 100% advance payments are available for claimants and budgeting support is available for anyone who needs extra help.</p>\n\n<p>The government has removed the 7-day waiting period meaning nobody has to wait to make a claim and people can continue to receive Housing Benefit for 2 weeks while they wait for the first payment.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, in addition to the Universal Credit childcare offer, the government provides a wide range of childcare support for families, including 30 free hours for 3 and 4-year-olds of working parents, 15 free hours for disadvantaged 2-year-olds and for all 3 and 4-year-olds.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press Office</h2>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release – 0203 267 5116</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-09-09T11:22:28.184Z"}]},"document_status":"published","created_by":"Jennifer Pharr Davis","last_updated_by":"Pasang Lhamu","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true}}
