11 July 2019, HM Land Registry will provide Local Land Charges (LLC) searches in the local authority area of Norwich City Council.","details":{"body":"<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://hmlandregistry.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/11/first-anniversary-of-the-digital-local-land-charges-register\">One year on from the launch of the centralised Local Land Charges Register</a>, Norwich City Council is the latest local authority to migrate its data to it, providing a quicker and simpler service for customers.</p>\n\n<p>Laura McGillivray, Chief Executive Officer at Norwich City Council, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Working with HM Land Registry has been a positive and collaborative process throughout. Some of our local land charges data was computerised but most was held in paper records, some going back to the 1950s. By updating and digitising all our local land charges data, we are providing confidence in the accuracy of the data and helping to improve the efficiency of buying and selling property in the Norwich area.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Karina Singh, Director of Transformation at HM Land Registry, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">People buying property in Norwich will now have access to instant local land charges search results, meaning it will be quicker and simpler to buy and sell a house across the area. I am delighted that homebuyers across Norwich will benefit from this revolutionary new national Local Land Charges Register.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As part of HM Land Registry’s digital transformation, which aims to make homebuying quicker, simpler and cheaper, in the last year the organisation has launched its innovative <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hm-land-registry-is-making-it-easier-to-remortgage\">digital mortgage</a> service, where millions of people can now sign their mortgage online and on the move through their phone or tablet. We have also successfully tested buying a house using blockchain technology and won <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hm-land-registry-wins-it-industry-awards\">awards</a> for improving systems across the organisation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"local-land-charges\">Local Land Charges</h2>\n\n<p>Norwich City Council is the sixth local authority to migrate its local land charges data to the new digital register since it was launched in July 2018. The other migrated local authorities are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Warwick District Council</li>\n  <li>Liverpool City Council</li>\n  <li>the City of London Corporation</li>\n  <li>Blackpool Council</li>\n  <li>Council of the Isles of Scilly</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Anyone can get instant online local land charges search results via GOV.UK using the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://search-local-land-charges.service.gov.uk/\">Search for Local Land Charges service</a>. Customers will need to continue to submit CON29 enquiries to the local authority.</p>\n\n<p>HM Land Registry’s business customers can use their existing portal and Business Gateway channels or their usual search providers to access Local Land Charges data for those local authorities which have migrated.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"watch-a-video-about-the-local-land-charges-service\">Watch a video about the Local Land Charges service</h3>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM5jbQiU1c4\">Watch our short video about the Local Land Charges service</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, read about the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-land-registry-local-land-charges-programme/local-land-charges-programme\">Local Land Charges Programme</a>.</p>\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d24572eed915d32e302ae92/norwich_skyline.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d24572ded915d32ebc2dd4c/norwich_skyline.jpg","alt_text":"Skyline of Norwich, showing the city's two cathedrals","caption":"","credit":"Andrew Hurley"},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-07-11T07:06:49.382Z"}]},"document_status":"submitted_for_review","created_by":"Sophia Danenberg","last_updated_by":"Adam Ondra","political":false,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
