Estuary Envoy and Chair of the Thames Estuary Growth Board</li>\n  <li>The new Thames Estuary Growth Board will be backed by £1 million of government funding</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p>Kate Willard, Director of Partnership Development with Stobart Group, has been appointed (30 October 2019) as the new Estuary Envoy by Thurrock Council on behalf of all Estuary partners.</p>\n\n<p>Acting as an advocate for the region, she will forge positive relationships with local businesses, communities and local authorities and work with the government to increase prosperity and opportunity for  local people.</p>\n\n<p>The first Estuary Envoy will act as the Chair of the Thames Estuary Growth Board which will receive £1 million of government funding to drive economic growth plans in the area.</p>\n\n<p>The announcement follows the government’s response to the Thames Estuary 2050 Growth Commission report in March 2019, which saw the government back the Commission’s ambitious plans to create 1.3 million new jobs and generate an extra £190 billion for the local economy.</p>\n\n<p>New Estuary Envoy, Kate Willard said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am honoured and proud to have been appointed Chair and am much looking forward to starting this journey with you and to delivering and reporting on our successes.</p>\n\n  <p>The Thames Estuary Growth Board has the opportunity to provide a clear and coherent voice to drive sustainable growth across this dynamic region.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">We will work to ensure we are listening to the communities, private and public sector partners who make up this great place and deliver cohesive leadership that helps shape an even more brilliant and shining place with international
