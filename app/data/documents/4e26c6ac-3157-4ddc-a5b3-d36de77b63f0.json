and travel industry call on holidaymakers and other travellers to check their MMR vaccinations are up-to-date, as measles outbreaks continue across Europe.","details":{"body":"<p>Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and sometimes leads to serious complications. The disease is still endemic in many countries around the world including Europe, with France, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and Germany among the countries reporting the highest case counts according to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/rubella/surveillance-and-disease-data/monthly-measles-rubella-monitoring-reports\">European Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (<abbr title=\"European Centres for Disease Control and Prevention\">ECDC</abbr>)</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mmr-vaccination-call-following-high-numbers-of-measles-cases\"><abbr title=\"Public Health England\">PHE</abbr> data published at the end of May</a> showed that measles remains a threat to the <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr> population, with 231 cases confirmed in England in the first quarter of 2019. The number of cases confirmed in England has been rising since 2018, with many linked to importations from Europe. Young people and adults aged 15 and over who missed out on the measles, mumps and rubella (<abbr title=\"Measles, mumps and rubella\">MMR</abbr>) vaccine when they were young and some under-vaccinated communities have been particularly affected.</p>\n\n<p>Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at Public Health England, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Measles can kill and is incredibly easy to catch, especially if you’re not vaccinated and travelling to affected countries. If you’re in any doubt about your – or your child’s - vaccination status, ask your <abbr title=\"general practitioner (family doctor)\">GP</abbr> or check your child’s Red Book. Before you travel you should ensure you and your family are up to date with all currently recommended <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr> vaccines and <abbr title=\"Measles, mumps and rubella\">MMR</abbr> is especially important if you’re planning to travel throughout the summer due to the ongoing outbreaks happening across Europe. It’s never too late to get protected.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nikki White, <abbr title=\"Association of British Travel Agents\">ABTA</abbr>’s Director of Destinations and Sustainability said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Travellers might not typically think to check vaccination requirements for travel to Europe, but we encourage everyone to check their health records and catch-up on any missed vaccinations wherever they are travelling to. No matter where people are going on holiday, we always encourage them to check the Foreign Office’s travel advice at the time of booking and before they are due to travel to make sure they are aware of the latest information about the destination and any health requirements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr>, <abbr title=\"Measles, mumps and rubella\">MMR</abbr> is usually given to infants at around 12 months of age, with a second dose given before school, to ensure best protection. In some cases, <abbr title=\"Measles, mumps and rubella\">MMR</abbr> can be offered to babies from 6 months of age (for example, for travel to countries where measles is common, or during an outbreak situation). Ask your health professional for advice on the best option for your children before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Two doses of <abbr title=\"Measles, mumps and rubella\">MMR</abbr> in a lifetime are needed for a person to be considered fully protected.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>The latest <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cover-of-vaccination-evaluated-rapidly-cover-programme-2018-to-2019-quarterly-data\"><abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr> quarterly data and commentary</a> on coverage achieved by the <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr> childhood immunisation programme is available online.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Travel health information can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/\">TravelHealthPro website</a>.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"measles-signs-and-symptoms\">Measles signs and symptoms</h3>\n\n<p>Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and sometimes lead to serious complications. It’s now uncommon in the <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr> because of the effective <abbr title=\"Measles, mumps and rubella\">MMR</abbr> vaccination programme. Although usually a mild illness in children, measles can be more severe in adults.</p>\n\n<p>The initial symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after a person is infected. These can include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40°C (104°F)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>a few days later, a red-brown blotchy rash will appear. This usually starts on the head or upper neck, before spreading outwards to the rest of the body</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Symptoms usually resolve in about 7 to 10 days.</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_3a83bad3-cd3d-4682-bc42-d9e6fb298d60\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Public Health England press office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Wellington House \n<br>\n133-155 Waterloo Road</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SE1 8UG</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n        <p class=\"email\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Email</span>\n          <a href=\"mailto:phe-pressoffice@phe.gov.uk\" class=\"email\">phe-pressoffice@phe.gov.uk</a>\n        </p>\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Telephone</span>\n          020 7654 8400\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out of hours</span>\n          020 8200 4400\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d0a3eed40f0b62009d70d9f/mmr-vaccine-image.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d0a3eec40f0b62009d70d9e/mmr-vaccine-image.jpg","alt_text":"Poster about Measles in Europe and the need for MMR immunisation","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-06-20T12:04:11.731Z"}]},"document_status":"submitted_for_review","created_by":"Arlene Blum","last_updated_by":"Jyoti Raju","political":false,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
