This can include workplace adaptations, assistive technology, transport and interpreters.</p>\n\n<p>It comes after the government increased the cap by almost a third last year. Now, even more people will be able to benefit, especially those from the deaf community who can get BSL interpreters through the scheme.</p>\n\n<p>Access to Work provides financial support to ensure someone’s disability or health condition doesn’t hold them back at work, and last year more than 27,000 people received support. This included adjustable desks, special IT equipment and voice-recognition software.</p>\n\n<p>The Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work, Sarah Newton, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Access to Work provides tailored support to thousands across the country, ensuring a disability or health condition is not a barrier to achieve someone’s career aspirations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">By extending this grant even more people can benefit from this personalised scheme, and more disabled people can thrive in the workplace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Latest figures show that last year Access to work provision for people with mental health conditions increased by 34% compared to the previous year, and for people with a learning disability it increased by 22%.</p>\n\n<p>Access to Work is part of a range of support available to ensure that all disabled people who want to work have the opportunity to achieve their career aspirations. The scheme is just one of the ways the government is ensuring that all disabled people who want to work have the opportunity to achieve their career aspirations.</p>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p>Find out more about <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work\">Access to Work </a> .</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The cap has been uprated in line with the annual survey of hours and earnings published by the Office for National Statistics, multiplied by 2.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press Office</h2>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release – 020 3267 5112</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow DWP on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-02-11T12:26:26.610Z"}]},"document_status":"published_but_needs_2i","created_by":"Catherine Destivelle","last_updated_by":"Dan Osman","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true}}
