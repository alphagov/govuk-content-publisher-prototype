HIV data shows a continued decline with new diagnoses at their lowest level since 2000.","details":{"body":"<p>Data published today, Tuesday 3 September 2019, by Public Health England (<abbr title=\"Public Health England\">PHE</abbr>) reveal that new <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> diagnoses in the UK have <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hiv-annual-data-tables\">fallen to their lowest level since 2000.</a> New diagnoses fell by almost a third (28%) from 6,271 in 2015 to 4,484 in 2018.</p>\n\n<p>New <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> diagnoses have been declining in both gay and bisexual and heterosexual populations. The steepest falls have been seen among gay and bisexual men, where new diagnoses declined by 39% between 2015 and 2018. The biggest falls have been among gay and bisexual men who are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>white (46% decrease from 2,353 in 2015 to 1,276 in 2018)</li>\n  <li>born in the UK (46% decrease from 1,627 in 2015 to 873 in 2018)</li>\n  <li>aged 15 to 24 (47% decrease from 505 in 2015 to 269 in 2018)</li>\n  <li>living in London (50% decrease from 1,459 in 2015 to 736 in 2018)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>During the same period, new diagnoses have also fallen by a quarter (24%) among people who acquired <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> through heterosexual contact.</p>\n\n<p>The continued decline of <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> diagnoses is largely due to the success of combination <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> prevention over the past decade, which includes <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> testing, condom provision, the scale-up of pre-exposure prophylaxis (<abbr title=\"pre-exposure prophylaxis\">PrEP</abbr>) and anti-retroviral therapy (<abbr title=\"anti-retroviral therapy\">ART</abbr>) – drugs that keep the level of <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> in the body low and prevent the virus being passed on.</p>\n\n<p>Dr Valerie Delpech, Head of <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> Surveillance at Public Health England, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is thanks to the enormous testing and prevention efforts in the UK that we are seeing further declines in new <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> diagnoses, which have now reached their lowest in almost 20 years. People with <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> now benefit from effective treatments that stop the virus being passed on to sexual partners and the number of people diagnosed late is lower than ever before.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Getting tested for <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> has never been easier, with free tests available through <abbr title=\"general practitioner (family doctor)\">GP</abbr> surgeries, local hospitals and sexual health clinics, as well as through a self-sampling service or by using a self-testing kit. Early diagnosis means early effective treatment, which can prevent you passing on <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The most common way of getting <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> in the UK is through unprotected sexual contact with a person unaware of their <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> infection. You can protect yourself from <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> through consistent and correct condom use with new and casual partners, through using <abbr title=\"pre-exposure prophylaxis\">PrEP</abbr>, or if your partner is living with <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr>, through knowing their virus is undetectable. Condom use will also stop you getting or transmitting other <abbr title=\"Sexually transmitted infections\">STIs</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>The quality of <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> care and treatment continues to be excellent in the UK. In 2018, 94% of people in the UK living with diagnosed <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> and accessing <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> treatment were virally suppressed and cannot pass on <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>Dying from <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> when diagnosed early in the UK is rare today. A person diagnosed early with <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> and on treatment now has the same life-expectancy as a person without <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>Despite falling rates of new diagnoses there remain challenges in ensuring that more people are diagnosed early. Almost half of people (43%) newly diagnosed with <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> in 2018 were at a late stage of infection, which increases the risk of death within a year ten-fold compared to people diagnosed promptly.</p>\n\n<p>Public Health Minister Jo Churchill said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am delighted to see new figures released today which show we are well on our way to achieving our ambition of zero <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> transmissions in England by 2030, with <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> diagnoses at their lowest level since 2000.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">This decline in diagnoses is a result of our unwavering commitment to prevention which has led to more people getting tested, and has allowed people with <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> to benefit from effective treatment, stopping the virus from spreading further. However, I am not complacent and remain dedicated to ensuring we reach our target of zero new <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> transmissions by 2030.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are very effective treatments for <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> that enable people diagnosed with the virus to live a long and healthy life and minimise the risk of onward transmission. Early diagnosis through regular testing ensures people get the greatest benefit from these <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> treatments. <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> testing is freely available through <abbr title=\"general practitioner (family doctor)\">GP</abbr> surgeries, local hospitals and sexual health clinics, as well as through a self-sampling service or by using a self-testing kit.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Public Health England\">PHE</abbr>, alongside other government and third sector organisations, is working to control <abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> by 2030 and these new figures are an encouraging sign that this is achievable.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"background\">Background</h3>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n<abbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> indicators are provided at local authority level on Public Health England’s Sexual and Reproductive Health Profiles.
