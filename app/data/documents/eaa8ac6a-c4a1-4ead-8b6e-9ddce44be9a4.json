new fund will help further develop projects around culture and heritage in the area.","details":{"body":"<p>A new £200,000 fund will help support and preserve Cornwall’s rich language, heritage and culture, Communities Minister Lord Bourne announced today (5 July 2019).</p>\n\n<p>In recognition of Cornish culture’s unique place in our nation, the funding will help deliver Cornish language education for adults and young people, tackle barriers to education around the traditions and heritage of Cornwall, and provide media and technology opportunities for learners and speakers of Cornish.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking at the UK National Minority Summit,</p>\n\n<p>Communities Minister Lord Bourne said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As England’s only recognised regional or minority language, we should support the Cornish language and help it flourish for generations to come.</p>\n\n  <p>Cornwall has a rich history and a distinctive identity, and it’s right that we are committed to promoting it.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">This new fund will help further develop projects around culture and heritage in the area.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The funding is recognition of the importance of Cornish history and Cornwall’s distinct culture and heritage, and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is keen to continue to work with Cornwall Council and its partners to encourage it’s further development.</p>\n\n<p>The new £200,000 funding from the government will sit alongside money from local partners to help promote Cornwall’s rich language, culture and heritage.</p>\n\n<p>Cornwall Councillor and Portfolio Holder for Culture, Economy and Planning, Bob Egerton, added:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Cornwall is a unique county and we welcome the funding announcement, which will allow us to preserve, share and develop our distinct culture and identity.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">The money will be used towards the development of a Cornish language programme and support the implementation of the Cornish National Minority Education Action Plan; all keys to unlocking the passion and protecting our culture for future generations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"further-information\">Further information</h2>\n\n<p>£200,000 financial support for 2019/20, to fund a range of Cornish language projects (£150k) and Cornish culture (£50k). The funding is broken down as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>£150k to Cornish language programme</li>\n  <li>£25k to Tackling Education Barriers</li>\n  <li>£10k to the Cornwall Culture Distinctiveness project</li>\n  <li>£10k to the Ordinalia Nessa work</li>\n  <li>£5k to the Gorsedh Youth Festival</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Cornish has been recognised as a protected minority language under the Council of Europe’s Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (ECRML) since 2002.</p>\n\n<p>In April 2014 the government formally recognised the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cornish-granted-minority-status-within-the-uk\">distinct identity of Cornish people</a> by granting them minority status under the European Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. This affords Cornish people the same status as the UK’s other Celtic people, the Scots, the Welsh and the Irish.</p>\n\n<p>Cornish language is the only language in England recognised under the Council of Europe’s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-charter-regional-or-minority-languages\">Charter for Regional or Minority Languages</a>.</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_bfc00333-a9ee-4ca1-9d3c-432dbcdf4640\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Office address and general enquiries</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">2 Marsham Street\n<br>\nLondon</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1P 4DF</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n        <p class=\"contact_form_url\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Contact form</span>\n          <a href=\"https://forms.communities.gov.uk/\">https://forms.communit...</a>\n        </p>\n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">General enquiries:  please use this number if you are a member of the public</span>\n          030 3444 0000\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"contact_c1f13fd8-9feb-4028-9323-7cb3383323b4\" class=\"contact\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Media enquiries</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n        <p class=\"email\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Email</span>\n          <a href=\"mailto:newsdesk@communities.gov.uk\" class=\"email\">newsdesk@communities.gov.uk</a>\n        </p>\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Please use this number if you are a journalist wishing to speak to Press Office</span>\n          0303 444 1209\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"contact_f375ee5c-c7f3-4e09-9ba8-2ca0308481c5\" class=\"contact\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Social media - MHCLG</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n    \n    \n      <p class=\"comments\">Twitter - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mhclg\">https://twitter.com/mhclg</a><br>Flickr - <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mhclg\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/mhclg</a><br>LinkedIn - <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/company/mhclg\">http://www.linkedin.com/company/mhclg</a></p>\n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d1f1a0eed915d0bc560c4db/coastal-st-ives-2-960x640.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d1f1a0de5274a08de32dc87/coastal-st-ives-2-960x640.jpg","alt_text":"St Ives in Cornwall","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-07-05T09:40:47.618Z"}]},"document_status":"draft","created_by":"Sophia Danenberg","last_updated_by":"John Long","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true}}
