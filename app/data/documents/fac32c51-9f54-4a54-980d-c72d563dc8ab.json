Cumbrian communications professional has won an international prize for her work to encourage more females into the nuclear industry.","details":{"body":"<p>Sellafield’s Ruth Hutchison picked up a FEM’Energia award at a ceremony in Paris hosted by France’s Women in Nuclear organisation.</p>\n\n<p>The event recognises people who  provide encouragement and  guidance  to  young  women involved  in  the  nuclear  industry.</p>\n\n<p>Ruth works as a strategic communications lead for the Sellafield Ltd’s Programme and Project Partners.</p>\n\n<p>A founding member of the Women in Nuclear (WiN) Cumbria branch, she was nominated for her work to promote a more diverse workforce in the region. </p>\n\n<p>Ruth, of Whitehaven, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I felt very lucky to represent Cumbria at such a prestigious event, and was even more delighted to win.</p>\n\n  <p>What makes me most proud is that the judges recognised the communications profession as important in addressing gender issues and changing things for the better.</p>\n\n  <p>I met lots of people trying to achieve the same things in France. They were really interested to hear what a supportive and ambitious community we have in Cumbria.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">I’d like to thank my colleagues at WiN Cumbria, WiN UK, Sellafield Ltd and in the local supply chain for their ongoing support.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Claire Gallery-Strong, Chair of WiN Cumbria regional team, added: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ruth couldn’t be more deserving; as a communications professional and a personal role model.</p>\n\n  <p>The fact that she accepted her award in French was equally as impressive!</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">The judges told the audience they selected Ruth as the winner because they were so impressed by her work to shine a light on important issues around diversity, not only in Cumbria and the UK, but also overseas. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5db6c3dfe5274a4aa423ea17/fem-energia-r-hutchison-c-gallery-strong.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5db6c3de40f0b6379cde834b/fem-energia-r-hutchison-c-gallery-strong.jpg","alt_text":"Ruth Hutchison pictured with Claire Gallery-Strong","caption":"Sellafield's Ruth Hutchinson and Claire Gallery-Strong, chair of WiN Cumbria","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-11-04T14:36:17.969Z"}]},"document_status":"draft","created_by":"Stefan Glowatz","last_updated_by":"Adam Ondra","political":false,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
