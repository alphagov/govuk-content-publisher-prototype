We need to work urgently to get behind a Brexit deal that protects this jobs record and gives employers the certainty to continue to invest in their workforce and boost wages.</p>\n\n<p>“With more people in work than ever before, it is welcome news that wages are continuing to rise at their fastest rate in a decade.</p>\n\n<p>“And by increasing the living wage and personal tax allowance for 2019, this government is putting more money in people’s pocket, benefiting millions of families across the country.”</p>\n\n<p>The government has made more changes to the tax system for 2019 to ensure people are keeping more of what they earn.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-universal-credit-work-allowance-is-increasing-by-an-extra-1000-per-year\">The Universal Credit work allowance is increasing by an extra £1,000 per year</h2>\n\n<p>From April, working parents and disabled people will be able to earn an extra £1,000 a year before their Universal Credit starts to reduce. This change will see 2.4 million families keep up to an extra £630 per year of what they earn.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"fuel-duty-will-remain-frozen-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row\">Fuel duty will remain frozen for the ninth year in a row</h2>\n\n<p>It will remain at 57.95 pence per litre across the UK. Fuel duty has been frozen for the ninth successive year, saving the average car driver £1,000.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"access-to-work-is-increasing-by-an-extra-2000-per-year\">Access to Work is increasing by an extra £2,000 per year</h2>\n\n<p>From 1 April 2019 people will be able to claim up to £59,200 annually through the Access to Work scheme to help pay for additional support that they may need in the workplace. This can include workplace adaptations, assistive technology, transport and interpreters.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press Office</h2>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release – 020 3267 5144</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow DWP on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5cb5ae7740f0b668699e255e/lms_0319_unmployment_gov-002.png","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5cb5ae77ed915d3f51602d36/lms_0319_unmployment_gov-002.png","alt_text":"Unemployment rate remains low at 3.9%","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-04-16T11:04:54.641Z"}]},"document_status":"published_but_needs_2i","created_by":"Joe Brown","last_updated_by":"Joe Brown","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
