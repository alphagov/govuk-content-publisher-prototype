funding will help tackle the biggest challenges in health and social care over the next 5 years, including dementia, obesity and mental health.","details":{"body":"<p>The NHS is partnering with universities, innovators and local authorities to solve some of the biggest issues facing health and social care over the next 5 years.</p>\n\n<p>The government is awarding funding through the National Institute for Health Research (<abbr title=\"National Institute for Health Research\">NIHR</abbr>) to 15 partnerships.</p>\n\n<p>The partnerships each have ground-breaking new projects aiming to address the increasing demands on the NHS and give patients greater independence and choice about how they manage their healthcare.</p>\n\n<p>The funding totals £135 million and could transform the lives of millions of people living with a range of conditions, including dementia, mental ill health and obesity.</p>\n\n<p>The extra funding follows a number of successful projects funded by <abbr title=\"National Institute for Health Research\">NIHR</abbr> in the past, including research which led to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-term-plan/\">Long Term Plan</a> commitment of every woman receiving care from the same midwife during pregnancy, birth and postnatally by 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Health Minister Nicola Blackwood said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As the population grows and demand on the NHS increases, it is paramount we develop the next generation of technologies and improve the way we work to ensure the NHS continues to offer world-leading care.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">The UK has a proud history of cutting-edge health research and, by supporting the great minds in health and social care, this funding has the potential to unlock solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing healthcare and revolutionise the way patients access treatments in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Scientific Adviser to the Department of Health and Social Care, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The unique local collective approach at each <abbr title=\"National Institute for Health Research\">NIHR</abbr> applied research collaboration will support applied health and care research that responds to, and meets, the needs of local patients, and local health and care systems.</p>\n\n  <p>The network will also be able to tackle health priorities at a national level.</p>\n\n  <p>The 15 new <abbr title=\"National Institute for Health Research\">NIHR</abbr> applied research collaborations will ensure that we grow applied health and care research in every region in England. </p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">The additional funding announced today means we will ensure that our world-leading research is turned into real benefits for patients to ensure the applied research collaborations work together to have national-level impact.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d26f77140f0b611f3b32532/female-patients-sitting-in-waiting-room.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d26f771e5274a5864497e34/female-patients-sitting-in-waiting-room.jpg","alt_text":"Female
