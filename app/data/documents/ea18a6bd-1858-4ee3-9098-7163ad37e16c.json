Acts of astonishing arrogance and abandon punished only with fines, barely denting bossesâ€™ bank balances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Meanwhile workers who have done the right thing and saved for retirement, confident their investments were safe, are left facing a leaner later life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">That cannot be right, which is why, for the first time, weâ€™re going to make wilful or reckless behaviour relating to pensions a criminal offence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The move is designed to ensure company bosses who allow deficits to escalate to unsustainable levels, or who endanger their workersâ€™ savings through chronic mismanagement, face the full force of the law.</p>\n\n<p>The intention to introduce a new criminal offence of wilful or reckless behaviour in relation to a pension scheme, and the recommended maximum sentence, is included in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/protecting-defined-benefit-pension-schemes-a-stronger-pensions-regulator\">governmentâ€™s response to a consultation on enhancing The Pensions Regulatorâ€™s powers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It comes as latest figures revealed more than 10 million people have been brought into workplace pensions saving by automatic enrolment since 2012.</p>\n\n<p>The milestone confirms the success of the governmentâ€™s flagship policy requiring employers to enrol eligible workers into a workplace pension scheme.</p>\n\n<p>Secretary of State Amber Rudd, added:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Automatic enrolment is an extraordinary success story. Thanks to this revolutionary reform, 10 million people can look forward to a more secure future and a better retirement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">That is a remarkable achievement. Workplace pensions had fallen out of fashion and were seen as the preserve of older, wealthier people. Now saving is the norm across the UK, wherever you work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">As we reflect on this milestone, we will of course be considering how we can reach even more people â€“ with our ambition to bring in younger workers and enable everyone, particularly part-time and lower earners and the self-employed, to save more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Minimum contribution rates under automatic enrolment are due to rise from 5% to 8% in April, as part of the governmentâ€™s plans to help people save even more.</p>\n\n<p>Attitudes towards workplace pension saving are positive and, thanks to automatic enrolment, pension saving is becoming normal. Saving behaviour is sticking: the first increase in minimum contributions which took place last year has not prompted people to stop saving.</p>\n\n<p>The proportion stopping saving through automatic enrolment was just 0.7% in the three months following the April 2018 increase in contribution rates, compared to 0.6% for the 4 year period beforehand.</p>\n\n<p>With record numbers investing in their retirement, the government is introducing a number of additional protections for savers, including a new authorisation regime to govern trusts administering pensions.</p>\n\n<p>The Department for Work and Pensions has already unveiled pioneering proposals to facilitate industry to deliver â€˜pensions dashboardsâ€™, providing all the facts and figures about someoneâ€™s pension savings in one place online.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press Office</h2>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release â€“ 020 3267 5084</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only â€“ not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow DWP on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-02-11T09:40:04.322Z"},{"note":"Added a link to the consultation response 'Protecting defined benefit pension schemes â€“ a stronger Pensions Regulator'.","public_timestamp":"2019-02-11T10:03:50.605Z"}]},"document_status":"scheduled","created_by":"Jyoti Raju","last_updated_by":"Sophia Danenberg","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
