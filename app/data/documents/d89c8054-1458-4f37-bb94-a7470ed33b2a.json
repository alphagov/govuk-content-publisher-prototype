3 attempted to escape the bailiff by running away and hiding in bushes before being caught.","details":{"body":"<p>The Environment Agency has successfully prosecuted 3 men from Liverpool for wilfully obstructing a water bailiff following an incident in Staffordshire last April.</p>\n\n<p>Jack O’Callaghan, 30, of Tynwald Place; Patrick Jones, 35, of Judges Drive and Alan Clelland, 56, of Snaefell Ave pleaded guilty in a case held at North Staffordshire Magistrates’ Court in Newcastle-Under-Lyme, on 9 September 2019.</p>\n\n<p>O’Callaghan was ordered to pay fines and costs totalling £480 while Jones and Clelland were each ordered to pay fines and costs totalling £400.</p>\n\n<p>O’Callaghan admitted 3 other charges in that he fished without a licence, fished in the close season and failed, when required to do so, to state his name and address to the bailiff.</p>\n\n<p>Jones admitted 2 other charges in that he fished in the close season and without a licence. Clelland admitted one other offence in fishing during the close season.</p>\n\n<p>Environment Agency enforcement officers received intelligence that 3 men were fishing on the River Trent at Great Haywood in Staffordshire on April 19, 2019.</p>\n\n<p>They were later spotted in the grounds of nearby Shugborough Hall where they were fishing the River Sow.</p>\n\n<p>EA officers and estate rangers attempted to speak with the men. However, a short foot chase ensued where the suspects became aggressive and also tried to hide within bushes.</p>\n\n<p>Having been joined by officers from Staffordshire Police, the men were eventually apprehended on the main road in Great Haywood.</p>\n\n<p>A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said: “This case shows how determined we are in catching and prosecuting people who flout the laws and obstruct our officers in carrying out their duties.</p>\n\n<p>“An annual fishing licence costs just £30, yet a small number of anglers continue to risk prosecution for fishing without a licence and breaching byelaws in place to protect fish stocks.”</p>\n\n<p>People caught fishing without a licence can be fined up to £2,500. Children under 13 do not need a licence. Licences for children aged between 13 and 16 are free, but a junior licence is required.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone who suspects illegal fishing to be taking place should report the matter to the Environment Agency’s incident hotline, on 0800 807060.</p>\n\n<p>Money raised from fishing licence sales is used to protect and improve fish stocks and fisheries, benefitting anglers and, for those caught cheating the system, we will always prosecute.</p>\n\n<p>For more information and to buy a rod licence go to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/buy-a-uk-fishing-rod-licence\">www.gov.uk/buy-a-uk-fishing-rod-licence</a>.</p>\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-09-13T10:22:16.262Z"}]},"document_status":"scheduled","created_by":"Wanda Rutkiewicz","last_updated_by":"Dave MacLeod","political":false,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true}}
