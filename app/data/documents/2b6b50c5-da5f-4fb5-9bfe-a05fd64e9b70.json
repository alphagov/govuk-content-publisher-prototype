Without phones and access to drugs, criminal networks will be severely hindered, prison officers will be protected, and ultimately the public will be safer.Â </p>\n\n<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We cannot allow our prisons to become factories for making bad people worse.</p>\n\n  <p>We will stop the drugs, weapons and the mobile phones coming in, so we can safeguard victims, protect staff, cut violence and make our prisons properly equipped to reform and rehabilitate.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">The public must see justice being done, punishment being served and feel protected.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Secretary of State for Justice, Robert Buckland QC MP said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a direct link between crime on the wings and crime on our streets - it can no longer be assumed that prison walls are enough to stop organised criminals from continuing their operations.</p>\n\n  <p>This funding will have a transformative effect on prisons and give our hard-working officers the advantage as they tackle this scourge head-on.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">By disrupting those who continue to offend behind bars, we can keep our staff and other prisoners safe, and make sure that prisons truly fulfil their purpose of protecting the public.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All prisons across the estate will benefit from the measures, with airport-style security being concentrated in the closed estate.</p>\n\n<p>The new security funding comes days after the Prime Minister announced a programme of up to Â£2.5 billion to create 10,000 additional prison places.</p>\n\n<p>The Â£100 million is the latest in a series of significant investments to increase security and stability in prisons, including Â£70 million announced previously. The Â£70 million funded new security measures such as improved search teams, a digital categorisation tool to better manage offendersâ risk, and improvements to the physical security and safety of the prison estate. Further funding has been made in previous years to build intelligence capabilities, a Financial Investigations Unit and a Serious and Organised Crime Task Force.</p>\n\n<p>This has come against a backdrop of rising prison officer numbers, with more than 4,700 now recruited since October 2016 and staffing levels at their highest since 2012.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"notes-to-editors\">Notes to editors</h3>\n\n<p>Further information on the Counter Corruption Unit, launched earlier this year, is available on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-prison-anti-corruption-taskforce-unveiled\">GOV.UK</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Further information on the Â£2.5 billion prison capacity investment programme, is available on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/10-000-extra-prison-places-to-keep-the-public-safe\">GOV.UK</a>.</p>\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d517c0a40f0b642c35d9ff0/prison-landings-3.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d517c08e5274a42d282e045/prison-landings-3.jpg","alt_text":"Prison landing","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-08-12T14:50:14.988Z"}]},"document_status":"submitted_for_review","created_by":"Sasha DiGiulian","last_updated_by":"Jaahnavi Sriperambuduru","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
