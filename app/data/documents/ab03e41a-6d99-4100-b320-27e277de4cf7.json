2019) confirmed he will lead ambitious plans to level up prosperity across the Midlands as the new Ministerial Champion for the Midlands Engine.</p>\n\n<p>A thriving Midlands is essential to a successful UK economy which is why the government is supporting the Midlands Engine Partnership to grow the Midlands economy and make the region an even better place to live, work, study and do business.</p>\n\n<p>The government is developing a refreshed Midlands Engine strategy which will reaffirm the government’s commitment to the Midlands and outline how the region can continue to build on its strengths.</p>\n\n<p>Local Government Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From growing up in Wolverhampton and Shropshire to proudly representing the people of Newark in Nottingham, the Midlands has made me who I am today so it’s a huge honour to now champion this incredible region in Cabinet and across government.</p>\n\n  <p>The continued success of the Midlands is not just personal to me, it is absolutely vital to our mission to level up our regions, boost economic growth and ensure every city and town can benefit from the opportunities Brexit brings.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">One of my first visits as Secretary of State was to Wolverhampton and I now look forward to working with Sir John Peace, as chair of the Midlands Engine Partnership, and everyone who shares my passion for the region and vision for a prosperous future for the whole Midlands at the heart of a thriving United Kingdom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sir John Peace, Chairman of the Midlands Engine Partnership, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I welcome the announcement that Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP has been appointed as the Midlands Engine Champion.
