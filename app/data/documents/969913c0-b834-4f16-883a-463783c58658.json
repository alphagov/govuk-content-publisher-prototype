By working with business, as we also do in our jobcentres,  we can put opportunities within a womanâs grasp, and support her to seize the chance to change her life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By supporting women who are leaving the criminal justice system into employment the charity is helping women reduce reoffending, with the reoffending rate for those placed in jobs by Working Chance at just 4%, compared to 58% among all ex-offenders.</p>\n\n<p>Emma Freivogal, Chief Operations Officer, Working Chance said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Working Chance has transformed the lives of thousands of women and their children to date but itâs vital that we continue to challenge the prejudices and preconceptions prevalent about ex-offenders among many employers and prevent women from becoming trapped in a cycle of poverty and offending. Â We were delighted to host the Secretary of State today and to show her first hand the difference that having secure employment makes to women who have been in prison.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Amber Ruddâs comments follow her previous announcements to improve support for women including scrapping the 2 child limit on Universal Credit for children born before April 2017, and piloting a more flexible approach to childcare provisions.</p>\n\n<p>The visit to the Working Chance headquarters in London also comes after the Justice Secretary David Gauke announced that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/justice-secretary-announces-new-female-offender-funding-at-womens-aid-speech\">community services supporting vulnerable women have been awarded Â£1.6 million funding</a>, as part of the governmentâs commitment to reduce the number of women entering the criminal justice system.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press Office</h2>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release â 020 3267 5144</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only â not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-04-26T07:54:03.937Z"}]},"document_status":"published","created_by":"Steph Davis","last_updated_by":"Melissa Arnot Reid","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
