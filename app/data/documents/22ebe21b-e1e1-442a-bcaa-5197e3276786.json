its lowest rate since 1974, once again shows the success of our balanced approach to managing the economy.</p>\n\n  <p>Rising wages and booming higher-skilled employment means better prospects for thousands of families, and with youth unemployment halving since 2010, we are creating opportunities for all generations. </p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">We now need to shift some of our focus to

continued its upward trend this month, growing by 3.2%, a 1.3% rise in real terms.</p>\n\n<p>Figures also show 3.9 million people from ethnic minority backgrounds are in work.
