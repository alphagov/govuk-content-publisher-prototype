CMA has provisionally cleared PayPalâ€™s completed takeover of mobile payments company iZettle after an in-depth, Phase 2, probe.","details":{"body":"<p>Both companies provide mobile point of sale (<abbr title=\"mobile point of sale\">mPOS</abbr>) devices that enable businesses to take â€˜offlineâ€™ payments through a card reader connected to a smartphone or tablet. The 2 companies are also active in the emerging market for â€˜omni-channelâ€™ payment services, through which businesses can take â€˜offlineâ€™ and â€˜onlineâ€™ payments through a single provider.</p>\n\n<p>An initial Phase 1 investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (<abbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\">CMA</abbr>) had raised concerns that PayPalâ€™s purchase of its rival might reduce competition in the supply of <abbr title=\"mobile point of sale\">mPOS</abbr> devices in the UK, with iZettleâ€™s customers, typically small and medium-sized businesses, paying higher prices or receiving a lower quality service.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\">CMA</abbr> was also concerned about the potential impact of the merger in â€˜omni-channelâ€™ payment services, where PayPal has already established a strong position and iZettle had been expanding its presence.</p>\n\n<p>The payments services sector is evolving and the <abbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\">CMA</abbr>â€™s Phase 2 investigation, led by an independent group of panel members, has considered in detail how competition between the merging businesses would have been likely to develop in future. The <abbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\">CMA</abbr> has reviewed extensive evidence, including large volumes of the merging businessesâ€™ internal documents, relating to PayPalâ€™s rationale for the merger and what the commercial strategies of PayPal and iZettle would have been if the merger had not taken place.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\">CMA</abbr> has also considered extensive evidence, including a survey of over 6,000 customers, relating to how they choose in practice between the more novel <abbr title=\"mobile point of sale\">mPOS</abbr> devices, such as those supplied by PayPal and iZettle, and â€˜traditionalâ€™ point of sale devices, such as those supplied by Worldpay and Barclaycard.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of this detailed investigation, the <abbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\">CMA</abbr> has provisionally found that the merger does not raise competition concerns.</p>\n\n<p>The investigation revealed that, while iZettle and PayPal are 2 of the largest suppliers of <abbr title=\"mobile point of sale\">mPOS</abbr> devices, their customers are also willing to switch to â€˜traditionalâ€™ POS devices. The 2 largest suppliers of payment services to smaller merchants, Worldpay and Barclaycard, account for almost 60% of the market at present and will continue to constrain the merged company.</p>\n\n<p>The merged company will also face significant competition from other <abbr title=\"mobile point of sale\">mPOS</abbr>-only players, such as Square and SumUp, which have both grown significantly in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>In omni-channel services, the <abbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\">CMA</abbr> found that iZettle would only have been able to develop its offering slowly and would have remained a marginal player for the foreseeable future. The <abbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\">CMA</abbr> also found that other significant competitors would be more important constraints on PayPal.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of this thorough investigation, the <abbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\">CMA</abbr> has provisionally found that the merger does not raise competition concerns.</p>\n\n<p>Kirstin Baker, the inquiry chair, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The payment services sector is dynamic, and our in-depth investigation has enabled us to carry out a large amount of further analysis about how competition is likely to develop in future.</p>\n\n  <p>As iZettle is a relatively recent entrant to payment services, and PayPal had pre-existing plans to invest in its product offering, it has been particularly important for us to verify in detail what could have happened had iZettle not been taken over.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">While iZettle and PayPal are 2 of the main suppliers of mobile point of service devices, the additional evidence we have analysed indicates that the distinctions between these and â€˜traditionalâ€™ point of service devices are reducing over time and that large numbers of customers can and do switch to â€˜traditionalâ€™ point of service devices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Further details are available on the investigationÂ <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/paypal-holdings-inc-izettle-ab-merger-inquiry\">case page</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"notes-to-editors\">Notes to Editors</h3>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>An offline payment is a â€˜card-presentâ€™ payment from customers in a face-to-face setting.Â  An online payment is a â€˜card-not-presentâ€™ payment from customers in an online setting.</li>\n  <li>The <abbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\">CMA</abbr> is the UKâ€™s primary competition and consumer authority. It is an independent non-ministerial government department with responsibility for carrying out investigations into mergers, markets and the regulated industries and enforcing competition and consumer law.</li>\n  <li>Media enquiries to the <abbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\">CMA</abbr> should be directed toÂ <a href=\"mailto:press@cma.gov.uk\">press@cma.gov.uk</a>Â or 020 3738 6460.</li>\n</ol>\n\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5cc81105ed915d5dc57b57a0/paypal-izettle.png","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5cc8110340f0b67681ef428c/paypal-izettle.png","alt_text":"Person paying at a cafe using a tablet device.","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-04-30T10:20:00.230Z"}]},"document_status":"submitted_for_review","created_by":"Wanda Rutkiewicz","last_updated_by":"Dave MacLeod","political":false,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true}}
