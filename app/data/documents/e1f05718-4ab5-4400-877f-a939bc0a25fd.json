The champions will be stationed across the country.</p>\n\n<p>Work and Pensions Secretary of State Thérèse Coffey said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The armed forces do our country proud and we are forever grateful to them for the sacrifices they make in order to serve our nation.</p>\n\n  <p>The Sun rightly champions the importance of looking after our heroes and their families – both while they are serving and once they have left the forces.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">This welcome new funding will provide specialist, individual support to former service personnel and their families as they take the first steps to find a job and receive the financial support they are entitled to, helping them better readjust to civilian life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Armed Forces Champions deliver employment support and benefits advice to former servicemen and women, and raise awareness of particular issues faced by veterans and their families. There are currently 46 Armed Forces Champions in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the jobcentre staff who are Armed Forces Champions have previously served in the forces and draw upon their own experiences to help veterans move forward.</p>\n\n<p>Neil Turner, Armed Forces Champion and Colchester Jobcentre work coach, was in the army for 30 years before working for <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>He said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">It can be a massive culture shock for those leaving the Armed Forces. Many don’t know what’s hit them. This funding will ultimately help ensure the right people are out there providing the right kind of support where it’s needed, when it’s needed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I’ve been honoured to spend time with many veterans and service personnel, and I’m constantly humbled by their service. They deserve our support to ensure they never find themselves out of work and without help.  </p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">That’s why we are spending up to £6 million to increase the number of Armed Forces Champions in our jobcentres. They’ll be a vital extra help as our former soldiers, sailors, airmen and women take the first steps into a new career.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press Office</h2>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release – 020 3267 5141</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-09-19T15:41:30.594Z"}]},"document_status":"published_but_needs_2i","created_by":"Sophia Danenberg","last_updated_by":"Ashima Shiraishi","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
