Apprentice Erin Tregunna has won the Radio Plymouth Apprentice of the Year award.","details":{"body":"<p>Erin, who appeared on Radio Plymouth to talk about her award, has been with HM Land Registry for a year. Working as a content designer, she has played a key role in HM Land Registry’s groundbreaking Digital Street research and development project.</p>\n\n<p>The project, which looks at how technology can improve and ultimately transform land registration, will allow HM Land Registry to explore and visualise different ideas of how land registration might work in the future and make conveyancing simpler, faster and cheaper. Now in its second year, the project is exploring the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts to bring greater transparency, speed and trust to property transactions.</p>\n\n<p>Commenting on her award Erin said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am absolutely delighted to have won the Radio Plymouth Apprentice of the Year award. Every day at HM Land Registry, I’m surrounded by passionate, energetic colleagues who inspire me to work hard and are role models for me within the IT sector. They’re all so supportive of my development as an apprentice and I’m truly grateful for all the time and energy that’s been invested in me, to mentor me and prepare me for my career.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">I am truly humbled to have been won this award and I can’t wait for the next half of my apprenticeship and what other opportunities HM Land Registry has in store for me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This award follows HM Land Registry winning two highly prestigious apprenticeship awards. In February 2019, HM Land Registry won the GOLD award for the Apprenticeship Programme of the Year from the Learning and Performance Institute. In October 2018, HM Land Registry won the Learning and Development award at the Guardian Public Service Awards for designing bespoke two-year paralegal and chartered legal executive apprenticeships.</p>\n\n<p>The new apprenticeship programme means for the first time experienced caseworkers can now progress to the lawyer grades, making it possible to join HM Land Registry as an entry-level caseworker and move up.</p>\n\n<p>Since the scheme was launched last year, 19 caseworkers aged between 21 and 59 have joined the programme.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone interested in an apprenticeship can <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry/about/recruitment\">take a look at our current vacancies and sign up to job alerts</a> to be notified when more apprenticeships are available.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"digital-street\">Digital Street</h3>\n\n<p>HM Land Registry’s ambition is to be at the forefront of innovation by exploring how land registration and conveyancing can be made easier and how technology and data could revolutionise the process.</p>\n\n<p>Digital Street is HM Land Registry’s research and development project designed to make buying and selling property simpler, quicker and cheaper through the innovative use of technology. Now in its second year, the project is exploring the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts to bring greater transparency, speed, and trust to property transactions.</p>\n\n<p>The project has already created a digital register for a small selection of properties, which is a first step towards establishing a register that is fully machine-readable and able to be updated instantly.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hm-land-registry\">HM Land Registry</h3>\n\n<p>HM Land Registry safeguards land and property ownership worth in excess of £4 trillion, including around £1 trillion of mortgages. The Land Register contains more than 25 million titles showing evidence of ownership for some 86% of the land mass of England and Wales.</p>\n\n<p>HM Land Registry’s mission is to guarantee and protect property rights in England and Wales.</p>\n\n<p>HM Land Registry is a government department created in 1862.</p>\n\n<p>For further information about HM Land Registry visit <a href=\"www.gov.uk/land-registry\">www.gov.uk/land-registry</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Follow us on: <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/HMLandRegistry\">Twitter @HMLandRegistry</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://hmlandregistry.blog.gov.uk/\">our blog</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://linkedin.com/company/land-registry\">LinkedIn</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HMLandRegistry\">Facebook</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact\">Contact</h2>\n\n<div id=\"contact_99f8f675-721e-4452-860d-48ded01591fb\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Trafalgar House</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">1 Bedford Park</span><br>\n<span class=\"region\">Croydon</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">CR0 2AQ</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n        <p class=\"email\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Email</span>\n          <a href=\"mailto:HMLRPressOffice@landregistry.gov.uk\" class=\"email\">HMLRPressOffice@landregistry.gov.uk</a>\n        </p>\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Phone (Monday to Friday 8.30am to 5.30pm)</span>\n          0300 006 3365\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Mobile (5.30pm to 8.30am weekdays, all weekend and public holidays)</span>\n          07864 689 344\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c8a3baf40f0b640db64a985/erin-tregunna-govuk.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c8a3baeed915d5c17158709/erin-tregunna-govuk.jpg","alt_text":"Erin Tregunna","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-03-14T13:32:33.780Z"}]},"document_status":"submitted_for_review","created_by":"Malavath Poorna","last_updated_by":"Gertrude Bell","political":false,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
