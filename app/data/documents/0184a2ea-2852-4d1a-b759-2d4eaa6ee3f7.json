new disability champions have been appointed by the government to ensure businesses are not forgetting about their disabled customers.","details":{"body":"<p>Using their industry influence, the champions will remove the obstacles faced by disabled consumers across the technology, countryside and heritage, products and spaces, brand and design and web accessibility sectors.</p>\n\n<p>Minister for Disabled People Sarah Newton said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For too long businesses have been missing out on the spending power of disabled customers and their families â€“ worth a staggering Â£249 billion a year.</p>\n\n  <p>Sadly disabled people are often locked out from the everyday experiences many of us take for granted, whether thatâ€™s enjoying the great outdoors or benefitting from latest innovations in technology.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Our new champions will fight for the rights of disabled consumers so they can spend their money where and when they want, just like everyone else.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They join 14 existing champions who have already made significant progress in improving accessibility across a diverse range of industries, from insurance to music.</p>\n\n<p>The new brand and design champion is Marianne Waite, founder and director of Think Designable and inclusive design consultant for Omnicom.</p>\n\n<p>Brand and design champion Marianne Waite said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Despite 90% of brands claiming to prioritise diversity and inclusion, only 4% consider the needs of disabled consumers.</p>\n\n  <p>I want to help hardwire inclusive design into mainstream brand practice and encourage creative teams to invest in insight from disabled consumers to drive much needed innovation.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Itâ€™s time for brands to wake up to the business, economic and social benefits of disability inclusion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"disability-champions\">Disability champions</h2>\n\n<p>The 5 new disability
