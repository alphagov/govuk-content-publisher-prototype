Secretary, Rt Hon Robert Buckland QC MP, attended a ceremonial groundbreaking event at the new prison site in Wellingborough today (17 September) to formally celebrate the construction which began earlier this year.","details":{"body":"\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<ul>\n  <li>Justice Secretary marks the start of construction at Wellingborough site</li>\n  <li>New jail will deliver major boost to the local economy and help to cut crime</li>\n  <li>Significant step in the Government’s vision of a modern, efficient prison estate</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p>The Justice Secretary was joined at the site by council leaders and senior representatives from Kier – who were awarded a £253 million contract earlier this year for the design and construction of the new prison.</p>\n\n<p>The 1,680-place category C jail is a major element of the Government’s bold strategy to create a modern, efficient prison estate that is fit for the future.</p>\n\n<p>The prison is expected to open in 2021 and will be built on the site of the previous HMP Wellingborough, which closed in 2012.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking at the event, the Justice Secretary told attendees that HMP Wellingborough will provide a major boost to the local economy - creating 100 new jobs and 50 apprenticeships, with a target of at least 25% of jobs being filled by ex-offenders. Once the jail becomes operational, hundreds of additional new jobs will be created in the prison.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Secretary, Rt Hon Robert Buckland QC MP, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Modern and efficient jails are at the heart of the Government’s plan to create a justice system that protects law-abiding citizens and cuts crime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">The new prison at Wellingborough will create and support hundreds of jobs, both during construction and afterwards, and will be a major boost to the local economy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">The prison will also provide a better environment to rehabilitate offenders and ultimately keep the public safer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The new jail at Wellingborough will provide almost half of the 3,500 new prison places that are already being delivered - with construction of a further prison at Glen Parva in Leicestershire, due to start in 2020, while a new houseblock at HMP Stocken in Rutland, opened in June.</p>\n\n<p>The Prime Minister also announced last month that the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/10-000-extra-prison-places-to-keep-the-public-safe\">Government will invest £2.5 billion</a> to transform the estate further, creating an additional 10,000 new places that will boost rehabilitation and cut reoffending. Outline planning permission for a new 1,440-place prison at Full Sutton was granted last week.</p>\n\n<p>The funding will also be used to bring previously decommissioned prison places back into use through extensive refurbishment and maintenance work.</p>\n\n<p>This comes alongside an investment of £100 million to bolster security and stability in prisons, in addition to £70 million committed previously.</p>\n\n<p>This will fund tough airport-style security, including X-ray scanners and metal detectors, across the prison estate to clamp down on the drugs, weapons and mobile phones that increase the risk to our officers and hinder rehabilitation.</p>\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d80f02640f0b61c992ba4b1/wellingborough-build-960x640.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d80f02540f0b61c992ba4af/wellingborough-build-960x640.jpg","alt_text":"Building work starts on new Wellingborough jail","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-09-17T14:39:34.829Z"}]},"document_status":"published_but_needs_2i","created_by":"Dave Graham","last_updated_by":"Chris Sharma","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
