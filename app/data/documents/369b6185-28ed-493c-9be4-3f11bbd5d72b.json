ground-breaking ceremony at Nesscliff Training Camp, near Shrewsbury in Shropshire, has marked the beginning of construction for new on-site, state-of-the-art, kitchen and dining facilities for military personnel undertaking pre-deployment training across the estate.","details":{"body":"<p>A £4 million investment will see the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO), its industry partner Landmarc Support Services Limited and local building contractor Pave Aways Limited, deliver an enhanced facility capable of feeding 600 armed forces personnel each meal time and up to 200 personnel in the field. It will also include additional storage and welfare space and improve the current disabled facilities on the site.</p>\n\n<p>Designed to meet the mandated 60-year life span for all new buildings, with enhanced thermal insulation and photovoltaic roof panels, the project supports the Ministry of Defence (MOD) Sustainable MOD Strategy and will significantly reduce ongoing maintenance and utilities costs for the MOD.</p>\n\n<p>The project is expected to have a positive impact on the local economy by sustaining around 300 jobs locally.</p>\n\n<p>DIO Training Safety Officer, Major (Ret’d) Richard Slaney, commented:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">DIO supports our armed forces by providing what they need to live, work and train. Nesscliff is a core site for military training within the West Midlands and surrounding counties, dealing with all priority military units’ pre-operational training. With the changes in regular army basing and the increase in UK-based troops, the new kitchen and dining facility will allow Nesscliff to support the inevitable increase in use, whilst providing the high quality service troops expect and deserve.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>John Shippen, Landmarc’s Project Manager added:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As DIO’s industry partner for the delivery of services across the national Defence training estate, we’re proud to be managing a project that will provide improved welfare facilities for our armed forces.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Not only will the new facilities enable an enhanced training experience for end users but they will be sustainable too, with far more efficient utilities, photovoltaic roof panels and better insulation, which will reduce running costs. We are also partnering with local contractors to provide additional employment and business opportunities for local people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Steven Owen, Managing Director of Pave Aways, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As the local contractor, we are delighted to be building this important facility at Nesscliff, which is where we secured our first ever contract 45 years ago.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">We estimate that the scheme will sustain more than 300 jobs through Pave Aways and our supply chain and are committed to working with contractors and sub contractors that are based within a 25-mile radius so it will have a positive impact on the local economy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5ca618f540f0b625dd1ce1b3/nesscliffe-kitchen-1.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5ca618f1ed915d0c52f334f3/nesscliffe-kitchen-1.jpg","alt_text":"A ground-breaking ceremony at Nesscliff marks the start of construction.
