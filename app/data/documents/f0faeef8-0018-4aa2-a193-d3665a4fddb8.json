grieving the loss of a loved one will find it easier to get help to meet upfront funeral costs.","details":{"body":"<p>Families grieving the loss of a loved one will find it easier to get help to meet upfront funeral costs, as a result of a new change to speed up <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/funeral-payments\">Funeral Expenses Payment</a> claims.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, a Funeral Expense Payment claim could not be processed without a confirmed date for the funeral to take place, which could lead to longer waiting times for payments to be processed.</p>\n\n<p>But following an important change, families will now be able to make a claim with an estimated funeral date, providing that other key information is supplied. The ability to use an estimated date in a claim is set to significantly speed up the process and payment. Â </p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> Minister Will Quince said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These important changes will make the very difficult time of planning a funeral or cremation that bit easier for bereaved families.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Helping families access Funeral Expenses Payments sooner and more quickly means they can focus on the much more important task of arranging a proper send-off for their loved one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Around 800 claims are received each week by the Department for Work and Pensions Bereavement Support team.</p>\n\n<p>This new move to speed up the Funeral Expenses Payment process is in addition to a recent change in the evidence required to process a claim. Recent improvements mean that instead of a final invoice â€“ which is usually received after the funeral â€“ families can instead supply a funeral director contract as an indication of funeral cost. This evidence can be submitted to the Bereavement Support team in advance of a funeral, therefore ensuring earlier access to financial support.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press Office</h2>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release â€“ 020 3267 5108</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only â€“ not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-07-17T10:24:57.767Z"}]},"document_status":"published_but_needs_2i","created_by":"Stephano Ghisolfi","last_updated_by":"Joe Brown","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true}}
