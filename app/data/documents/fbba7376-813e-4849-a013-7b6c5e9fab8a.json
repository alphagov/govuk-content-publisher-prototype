is the first milestone in the Prime Minister’s pledge for 10,000 new prison places.","details":{"body":"\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<ul>\n  <li>green light for new 1,440-capacity prison in East Yorkshire</li>\n  <li>new prison will create jobs and boost local economy</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p>Plans for a new modern jail at Full Sutton have been approved today (12  September 2019) – paving the way for the first of the 10,000 additional prison places.</p>\n\n<p>The prison is the first major step in the government’s £2.5 billion programme to transform the estate, providing modern and efficient jails that will boost rehabilitation and cut reoffending.</p>\n\n<p>The new 1,440-place category C resettlement prison will open in 2024 and stand alongside the existing, well-performing maximum-security jail at Full Sutton in East Yorkshire.</p>\n\n<p>Prisons Minister Lucy Frazer QC MP said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The new jail at Full Sutton is the first milestone in our long-term plan to deliver 10,000 additional modern and efficient prison places.</p>\n\n  <p>It will create and support hundreds of jobs, during construction and afterwards, and will be a major boost to the local economy.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">The prison will also provide a better environment to steer offenders away from crime – ultimately keeping the public safer and reducing the number of future victims.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Outline planning permission for a new prison at Full Sutton was granted by East Riding of Yorkshire Council today following extensive consultation with local residents and stakeholders.</p>\n\n<p>The expansion is part of a long-term £2.5 billion programme to transform our jails, with 10,000 additional places set to reduce crowding and create an estate that is fit for the future.</p>\n\n<p>The 10,000 places will be in addition to the new prisons that have already been announced, at Wellingborough and Glen Parva, which will provide 3,360 places by 2023.</p>\n\n<p>The £2.5 billion investment – announced by the government last month - will also be used to bring previously decommissioned prison places back into use through extensive refurbishment and maintenance work.</p>\n\n<p>This comes alongside an investment of £100 million to bolster security and stability in prisons, in addition to £70 million announced previously.</p>\n\n<p>This will fund tough airport-style security, including X-ray scanners and metal detectors, across the prison estate to clamp down on the drugs, weapons and mobile phones that increase the risk to our officers and hinder rehabilitation.</p>\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d7a5d5ee5274a20381543f9/pentonville.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d7a5d5d40f0b61c786baed1/pentonville.jpg","alt_text":"Prison
