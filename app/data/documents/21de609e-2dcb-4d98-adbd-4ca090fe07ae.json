approval has been given for a £2.8 million trial to prevent Group B Strep being passed on to newborn babies.","details":{"body":"<p>Health Minister Nadine Dorries has announced today that the Group B Strep trial has been given ethical approval by the Health Research Authority in England and Health and Care Research in Wales.</p>\n\n<p>Group B Strep is the most common cause of life-threatening infection in newborn babies, causing a range of serious infections including pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis.</p>\n\n<p>The results of the trial will be used to inform the future of pregnancy care across the United Kingdom and could help save babies’ lives.</p>\n\n<p>The trial will involve 80 hospitals in England, Wales and Scotland and at least 320,000 women will take part. Recruitment will start in spring 2020.</p>\n\n<p>The trial will be funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). It will look at the effectiveness of 2 different tests compared with standard care:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a lab-based test, the Enriched Culture Medium (<abbr title=\"Enriched Culture Medium\">ECM</abbr>) test at 35 to 37 weeks of pregnancy</li>\n  <li>a ‘bedside test’ at the start of labour</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Enriched Culture Medium\">ECM</abbr> test is currently recommended for use on high-risk groups in late pregnancy by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists’ clinical guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>Group B Strep infections in newborn babies can usually be prevented by giving antibiotics through a vein to women during labour, which reduces the risk by up to 90%.</p>\n\n<p>The UK currently does not routinely test pregnant women for Group B Strep, and instead identifies pregnant women with risk factors for their newborn developing the infection.</p>\n\n<p>Research has shown:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a 31% rise in the prevalence of Group B Strep infections in babies under 3 months old since 2000 in the UK and Ireland with 65% of the mothers of affected babies showing no risk factors</li>\n  <li>the bacteria are present in approximately 1 in 5 pregnant women, usually causing no harm to the carrier, but may be passed unknowingly from a mother to her baby around birth</li>\n  <li>one in 1,750 newborn babies will develop a Group B Strep infection. One in 19 of these babies will die and 1 in 14 survivors will be left with long-term disability</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Health Minister Nadine Dorries said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Every baby deserves the best start to life, so I’m thrilled this hugely important trial has been given the green light.</p>\n\n  <p>This is an issue I’ve been closely involved with for some time and I’m determined to do everything I can to raise awareness and help protect mothers and their newborns from the devastating impact this infection can have.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">We want the NHS to be the safest place in the world to give birth and this trial will be an important step in understanding if universal screening of Group B Strep can save the lives of more babies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jane Plumb MBE, Chief Executive of Group B Strep Support, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We are delighted that the GBS3 trial is progressing and has the support of the government. This major trial is comparing 2  types of testing versus a risk-factor approach. The results will drive improvements in UK and international policy and lead to fewer babies and their families suffering the trauma that Group B Strep infection can bring.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">After routine testing was introduced in the United States, the rate of early-onset Group B Strep infection dropped by over 80% and is now less than half that of the UK. Were the same to happen in the UK, approximately 350 babies every year would be protected from Group B Strep infections, saving 15 babies’ lives and preventing another 15 from developing life-changing disability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dbb066b40f0b6379cde83d2/nurse-looking-after-baby.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dbb066be5274a4aa63ec016/nurse-looking-after-baby.jpg","alt_text":"Nurse looking after a baby","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-10-31T17:23:37.393Z"}]},"document_status":"scheduled","created_by":"Robyn Erbesfield-Raboutou","last_updated_by":"Lucy Walker","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
