Agency teams, assisted by the military and emergency services, continue to work 24/7 to reduce the water levels in flood-hit communities, including Fishlake, and prepare them for further possible flood impacts today.","details":{"body":"<p>So far 38 pumps have been set up across South Yorkshire, including at eight separate locations in the Fishlake area, moving 50 million litres of water per hour to help protect homes and businesses.</p>\n\n<p>The pumps have removed 1.25 million tonnes of water in the past 24 hours and this has helped to reduce water levels in the village from 2 metres to 0.3 metres - a decrease of 85%.</p>\n\n<p>Environment Agency crews will install more pumps at Fishlake today. Around 200 EA operational staff have been out on sites in Yorkshire assisting with pumping, and deploying sandbags and temporary barriers ahead of likely further rainfall today.</p>\n\n<p>Army personnel were also deployed yesterday to help in the area.</p>\n\n<p>Approximately 14,400 properties have been protected by flood defences, including nearly 5,000 properties in South Yorkshire.</p>\n\n<p>Kate Marks, Flood Duty Manager at the Environment Agency, said:</p>\n\n<p>“Heavy rain today is expected to cause river and surface water flooding across parts of England, continuing into tomorrow in some areas, as well as potentially contributing to ongoing flood impacts in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire.</p>\n\n<p>“Our thoughts are with those communities who have been hit by floods and suffered the devastating effects over the past few days. Today we ask them to please remain vigilant and take steps to prepare for flooding by checking their flood risk regularly and making plans to stay safe.</p>\n\n<p>“The Environment Agency has teams working around the clock on the ground pumping away flood water, erecting temporary barriers and delivering sandbags to areas expecting further rainfall.</p>\n\n<p>“Our incident rooms remain open 24 hours a day, working closely with local authorities and partners.”</p>\n\n<p>To keep safe and stay informed please go to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/warnings\">https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/warnings</a></p>\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dcd4a63ed915d0721ddcd3b/img_2463.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dcd4a63e5274a0741e33b4e/img_2463.jpg","alt_text":"An Environment Agency officer operating a water pump next to a road with an EA vehicle parked nearby","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-11-14T12:36:59.351Z"}]},"document_status":"scheduled","created_by":"Sophia Danenberg","last_updated_by":"Jennifer Pharr Davis","political":false,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
