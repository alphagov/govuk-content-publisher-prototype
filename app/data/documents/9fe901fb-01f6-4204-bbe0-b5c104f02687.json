transformational projects along the Great British Coast have been awarded over £10 million from the government’s Coastal Communities Fund.","details":{"body":"\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<ul>\n  <li>People living in 5 more coastal communities set to benefit from new government investment</li>\n  <li>Projects from Cumbria to Kent to receive money to boost prosperity as part of drive to level up every part of the UK</li>\n  <li>Government is investing over £200 million in the Great British Coast by 2021</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p>The cash boost will support coastal projects in Cumbria, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Kent and Suffolk to create jobs, boost tourism, improve transport and protect much-loved coastal heritage sites.</p>\n\n<p>The fund helps to develop and improve local attractions, create jobs and promote socio-economic growth.</p>\n\n<p>The Coastal Communities Fund projects announced today are forecast to support nearly 1,000 jobs and attract up to £7.9 million in additional investment from public and private sector sources.</p>\n\n<p>This latest announcement brings the total Coastal Communities Fund investment to £228 million which is supporting 359 projects across the UK which are forecast to create over 20,000 jobs and builds on the government’s commitment to level up every place to ensure people have opportunities to prosper, no matter where they live.</p>\n\n<p>The government has also supported 184 “at risk” coastal heritage assets such as seafront piers, promenades, lighthouses, lidos and marinas with a further £7.5 million investment from the Coastal Revival Fund to allow them to reach their full economic potential.</p>\n\n<p>The government recently announced the first 100 places to benefit from the £3.6 billion Towns Fund which will  enable local people to come together to develop a new generation of multi-million-pound Town Deals which will transform their town’s economic growth prospects with a focus on improved transport, broadband connectivity, social and cultural infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>Minister for the Northern Powerhouse and Local Growth, the Rt Hon Jake Berry MP, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ensuring our coastal towns have the support they need to thrive is at the heart of this Government’s plan to level up every part of the UK.</p>\n\n  <p>Building on our £228 million investment into coastal communities, the projects receiving funding today were designed by local people who know best what will bring the biggest benefit to their community.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Their fantastic ideas demonstrate the raw potential of our coastal towns and will help create good jobs, boost economic growth and improve people’s lives as we leave the EU on 31 October.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"further-information\">Further information</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coastal-communities\">Coastal Communities Fund</a> was introduced in 2012. This latest announcement brings the total Coastal Communities Fund investment to £228 million which is supporting 359 projects across the UK.</p>\n\n<p>The government has also supported 184 “at risk” coastal heritage assets such as seafront piers, promenades, lighthouses, lidos and marinas with a further £7.5 million investment from the Coastal Revival Fund to allow them to reach their full economic potential.</p>\n\n<p>The latest projects to receive funds are:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cumbria-coastal-activities-centre---245-million\">Cumbria Coastal Activities Centre - £2.45 million</h3>\n\n<p>The centre will create a dedicated facility for water sports and recreational activities at Whitehaven Harbour.
