Many current and former apprentices will go back to school to tell their story, attracting  the next generation of  apprentices, so they too can fire up their future career.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the 13  years, National Apprenticeship Week has brought together apprenticeship supporters from across the country, with MPs, ambassadors, apprentices, training providers and top employers involved in  recognising the value and importance  of apprenticeships.</p>\n\n<p>For NAW2020 we want even more people to get behind the week, to build on last year’s success, which included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Over 1250 events taking place across England;</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <h1 id=\"naw2019-national-apprenticeship-week-and-blazeatrail-all-trending-uk-wide-on-twitter-over-the-course-of-the-week\">NAW2019, National Apprenticeship Week and #BlazeATrail all trending UK wide on Twitter over the course of the Week;</h1>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Over 30,000 unique visits to the NAW resource pages on GOV.UK;</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>And a hugely successful #askanapprentice day with employers, including TUI, Bentley Careers, Siemens UK, AXA Insurance and Cisco all getting involved.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Anne Milton, Minister for Apprenticeships and Skills said:</p>\n\n<p>“I am thrilled that National Apprenticeship Week 2020 will take place during early February 2020. It’s a chance to celebrate apprentices and the brilliant work being done by schools, the FE sector and employers across the country to promote the huge benefits of apprenticeships.</p>\n\n<p>“Apprenticeships offer people of all ages and backgrounds a high-quality route to skilled employment with the option to train at every level in a range of exciting professions like aerospace engineering, data science, teaching, law, nursing, and fashion. </p>\n\n<p>“This year we had over 1250 events and 1900 articles and features in publications from the Financial Times to Cosmopolitan. I would encourage employers, training providers, schools, apprentices and our ambassador networks to start considering how they will get involved in National Apprenticeship Week 2020.  We want next year to be even bigger and better reaching even more people and employers so they understand the advantages apprenticeships bring”.</p>\n\n<p>The theme of National Apprenticeship Week 2020 will be announced in the Autumn.</p>\n\n<p>Keith Smith, apprenticeships director, Education and Skills Funding Agency/Department for Education added:</p>\n\n<p>“A week-long celebration of all things apprenticeships gives opportunity to recognise the importance of apprenticeships and their impact. National Apprenticeship Week also enables employers, providers, partners and apprentices themselves to creatively celebrate what apprentices achieve and the impact they have locally, regionally and nationally.</p>\n\n<p>“In the coming months we will release more details for the Week 2020, but by sharing the date in advance I am hopeful that our many partners will start to plan some fresh and inspiring activity that they will run during National Apprenticeship Week 2020.”</p>\n\n<p>More information on National Apprenticeship Week 2020 will be announced on GOV.UK and on social media channels.
