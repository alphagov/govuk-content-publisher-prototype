This collaborative approach is an important part of the government’s Local Digital Declaration to coordinate public bodies seeking digital solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Different stages of projects have different names. Discovery projects explore problems and propose possible solutions, those called ‘alpha’ build prototypes and test solutions, and the ‘discovery’ stage builds a working service for public testing.</p>\n\n<p>The fund is also paying for in digital skills and leadership training for council staff.</p>\n\n<p>Projects funded and the local authorities involved:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Improving data and evidence on children in care; Greater Manchester Combined Authority - £100,000.
