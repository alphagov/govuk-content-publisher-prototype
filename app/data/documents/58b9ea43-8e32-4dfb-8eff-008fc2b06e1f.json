Keep Antibiotics Working campaign returns, urging people to always take their doctor's, pharmacist's or nurse’s advice on antibiotics.","details":{"body":"<p>Public Health England (<abbr title=\"Public Health England\">PHE</abbr>)’s latest <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/english-surveillance-programme-antimicrobial-utilisation-and-resistance-espaur-report\">English Surveillance Programme for Antimicrobial Utilisation and Resistance (<abbr title=\"English Surveillance Programme for Antimicrobial Utilisation and Resistance\">ESPAUR</abbr>) report</a> shows that there were an estimated 61,000 antibiotic resistant infections in England during 2018 - a 9% rise from 2017.</p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/resources/campaigns/58-keep-antibiotics-working/Overview\">Keep Antibiotics Working campaign</a> is back to alert the public to the risks of antibiotic resistance, urging people to always take their doctor, pharmacist or nurse’s advice on antibiotics.</p>\n\n<p>Antibiotics are essential to treat serious bacterial infections such as pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis. They also help to ward off infections during chemotherapy, caesarean sections and other surgeries.</p>\n\n<p>However, while antibiotics are vital to treating life-threatening infections, they are frequently being used to treat less serious illnesses such as coughs, earache and sore throats that can get better by themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Taking antibiotics encourages harmful bacteria that live inside you to become resistant, meaning that antibiotics may not work when they are really needed.</p>\n\n<p>When an infection – such as a urinary tract infection (<abbr title=\"Urinary Tract Infection\">UTI</abbr>) or skin infection – doesn’t respond to an antibiotic, it has the potential to cause serious complications, including bloodstream infections and hospitalisation.</p>\n\n<p>The threat of antibiotic resistance continues to grow and the <abbr title=\"English Surveillance Programme for Antimicrobial Utilisation and Resistance\">ESPAUR</abbr> report shows that antibiotic-resistant bloodstream infections - which can be very serious - rose by a third (32%) between 2014 and 2018.</p>\n\n<p>As well as urging the public to always take their doctor’s, pharmacist’s or nurse’s advice on antibiotics, the Keep Antibiotics Working campaign provides effective self-care advice to help people and their families feel better if they are not prescribed antibiotics. The campaign includes TV, radio and digital advertising.</p>\n\n<p>Dr Susan Hopkins, <abbr title=\"antimicrobial resistance\">AMR</abbr> Lead, Public Health England said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We want the public to join us in tackling antibiotic resistance by listening to your <abbr title=\"general practitioner (family doctor)\">GP</abbr>, pharmacist or nurse’s advice and only taking antibiotics when necessary.</p>\n\n  <p>Taking antibiotics when you don’t need them is not a harmless act – it can have grave consequences for you and your family’s health, now and in the future.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">It’s worrying that more infections are becoming resistant to these life-saving medicines, and we must act now to preserve antibiotics for when we really need them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"English Surveillance Programme for Antimicrobial Utilisation and Resistance\">ESPAUR</abbr> report highlights that changes in antibiotic use are associated with changes in antibiotic resistance. There has been a 17% drop in antibiotic prescriptions written and dispensed in general practice since 2014.</p>\n\n<p>There is no evidence that reduced antibiotic use in primary case has led to more people being admitted to hospital with serious infections.</p>\n\n<p>Dr Hopkins also commented:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">We have seen positive steps taken to reduce antibiotic use without affecting people’s recovery when they are unwell, and <abbr title=\"general practitioners (family doctors)\">GPs</abbr> should be congratulated in their ongoing work to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Antibiotics are one of the most powerful tools we have against infection. Resistance to these drugs therefore places much of modern medicine in jeopardy. A key component of our response to this problem is to ensure people use antibiotics appropriately.</p>\n\n  <p>The decrease in consumption of antibiotics is good news but the rise in resistant infections shows the threat is increasing and so there is more to be done.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Antibiotic resistance is not just a matter for clinicians – the public also have a crucial role to play in helping to preserve these vital medicines.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of the Royal College of <abbr title=\"general practitioners (family doctors)\">GPs</abbr> said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Antibiotics can be lifesaving drugs, but when bacteria become resistant to them – as they increasingly are – they will cease to work, and in many cases we will then have no viable therapeutic alternative, which could be disastrous for the patients affected.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\"><abbr title=\"general practitioners (family doctors)\">GPs</abbr> are already doing a good job at reducing antibiotics prescribing, but it can’t be our responsibility alone – we need the public to understand that antibiotics are neither a cure nor an appropriate treatment for many minor self-limiting conditions and viral infections, and if a <abbr title=\"general practitioner (family doctor)\">GP</abbr> advises against antibiotics, they are doing their best for the patient’s own good, and that of wider society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/english-surveillance-programme-antimicrobial-utilisation-and-resistance-espaur-report\"><abbr title=\"English Surveillance Programme for Antimicrobial Utilisation and Resistance\">ESPAUR</abbr> report</a> is available online.</p>\n\n<p>Antibiotic-resistant infections rose from 55,812 to 60,788 between 2017 and 2018.</p>\n\n<p>Antibiotic-resistant bloodstream infections increased from 12,972 in 2014 to 17,108 in 2018.</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_3a83bad3-cd3d-4682-bc42-d9e6fb298d60\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Public Health England press office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Wellington House \n<br>\n133-155 Waterloo Road</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SE1 8UG</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n        <p class=\"email\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Email</span>\n          <a href=\"mailto:phe-pressoffice@phe.gov.uk\" class=\"email\">phe-pressoffice@phe.gov.uk</a>\n        </p>\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Telephone</span>\n          020 7654 8400\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out of hours</span>\n          020 8200 4400\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dbab3ab40f0b63797afcd08/antimicrobial_resistance.png","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dbab3ab40f0b637a38efaec/antimicrobial_resistance.png","alt_text":"A close up view of antibiotics.","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-10-31T10:13:00.247Z"}]},"document_status":"scheduled","created_by":"Adam Ondra","last_updated_by":"Wanda Rutkiewicz","political":false,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true}}
