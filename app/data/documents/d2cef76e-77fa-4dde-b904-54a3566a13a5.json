the government on how best to establish the powerful new Building Safety Regulator, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick announced today (28 October 2019).</p>\n\n<p>The appointment follows Dame Judith’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/independent-review-of-building-regulations-and-fire-safety-hackitt-review\">Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety</a>, in which the government committed to take forward all of her recommendations and go further, by forming a new national Building Safety Regulator.</p>\n\n<p>The Regulator will oversee the design and management of buildings, with a strong focus on ensuring the new regime for higher-risk buildings is enforced effectively and robustly. It will also have the power to apply criminal sanctions to building owners who do not obey the new regime. </p>\n\n<p>The Communities Secretary, Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am grateful that Dame Judith has agreed to advise my department on the new Building Safety Regulator.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Her expertise will be essential to forming a strong Regulator with teeth to ensure all residents are safe, and feel safe, in their homes both now and in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"further-information\">Further information</h2>\n\n<p>Dame Judith Hackitt was commissioned by the government to review building regulations and fire safety following the Grenfell Tower fire.
