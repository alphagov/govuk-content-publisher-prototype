Nearly 290,000 people of State Pension age are in receipt of <abbr title=\"Personal Independence Payment\">PIP</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>From Friday, new claimants to <abbr title=\"Personal Independence Payment\">PIP</abbr> whose review would have been scheduled after they had reached State Pension age will receive an ongoing award with a light touch review at 10 years.</p>\n\n<p>Work and Pensions Secretary of State Amber Rudd said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have set out a number of initiatives to improve the quality of life for disabled people; to level the terrain and smooth their path.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Stopping unnecessary <abbr title=\"Personal Independence Payment\">PIP</abbr> reviews for people over State Pension age is a positive change. It applies a common-sense approach to treating those whose conditions are unlikely to change, and we want to introduce it as quickly as possible for those who will benefit from it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Minister for Disabled People Justin Tomlinson said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We are determined to improve our support for disabled people, and stopping needless <abbr title=\"Personal Independence Payment\">PIP</abbr> reviews for pensioners is the right thing to do.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">This step means new claimants to <abbr title=\"Personal Independence Payment\">PIP</abbr> who reach State Pension age before their review is due won’t have one unless they tell us their needs have changed, and the next step is to bring this in for all pensioners.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Applying this change to new claimants is the first step and it will be extended to existing <abbr title=\"Personal Independence Payment\">PIP</abbr> claimants above State Pension age in the coming months.</p>\n\n<p>This change was part of a wider package of measures announced by Amber Rudd, signalling a shift in the government’s support for disabled people.</p>\n\n<p>Other improvements include combining the separate assessment processes for <abbr title=\"Personal Independence Payment\">PIP</abbr>, Employment Support Allowance and Universal Credit into one integrated service from 2021.</p>\n\n<p>The integrated service will simplify the assessment process for millions of people claiming health related benefits, reducing the need to submit information multiple times and for some people reducing the number of face-to-face assessments.</p>\n\n<p>A small-scale test to explore the viability of a single assessment for Work Capability Assessments and <abbr title=\"Personal Independence Payment\">PIP</abbr> assessments will also be undertaken.</p>\n\n<p>The government will also work with stakeholders to understand how to help people submit the right evidence with their claim at the outset so that fewer people have to take their case to Tribunal.  </p>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p>Read the Secretary of State’s speech <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/closing-the-gap-between-intention-and-experience\">Closing the gap between intention and experience</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press Office</h2>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release – 020 3267 5111</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a>  </li>\n  <li>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a>  </li>\n  <li>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a>  </li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-05-29T09:24:45.064Z"}]},"document_status":"submitted_for_review","created_by":"John Long","last_updated_by":"Don Whillans","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
