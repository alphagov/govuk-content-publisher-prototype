This assessment will include the wider measurement framework presented by the Social Metrics Commission covering the depth, persistence and lived experience of poverty.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> will publish these experimental statistics in the second half of 2020 after and in addition to the government’s annual official <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/households-below-average-income-hbai--2\">Households Below Average Income (<abbr title=\"Household Below Average Income\">HBAI</abbr>)</a> publication. The <abbr title=\"Household Below Average Income\">HBAI</abbr> figures are based on households’ incomes and will continue to be the main measure of poverty in the UK whilst these experimental statistics are developed.</p>\n\n<p>Minister for Family Support, Housing and Child Maintenance Will Quince said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tackling poverty is a priority for this government. We welcome the work the Social Metrics Commission has done to find new ways to understand the lives and experiences of those who are in poverty.</p>\n\n  <p>Employment is at record levels and income inequality and absolute poverty are still lower than in 2010, but nonetheless we know some families need more support. That is why we continue to spend £95 billion a year on working age benefits, and we are looking at what more can be done to help families improve their life chances.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Our <abbr title=\"Household Below Average Income\">HBAI</abbr> figures are National Statistics based on incomes and give us a strong statistically robust picture of the levels of poverty in the UK. However, the Social Metrics Commission makes a compelling case for why we should also look at poverty more broadly to give a more detailed picture of who is poor, their experience of poverty and their future chances of remaining in, or entering, poverty. We look forward to exploring the merits of developing a new measure with them and other experts in this field. In the long run this could help us target support more effectively.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Social Metrics Commission Chair Philippa Stroud said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am delighted that the government is taking poverty measurement seriously. Without effective measures of poverty, we cannot hope to reduce the number of people who experience it or improve the lives of people who live in poverty.</p>\n\n  <p>The Social Metrics Commission has worked hard over the last 3 years to build a broad coalition of support and develop metrics that we believe represent a significant step forward in our ability to measure and understand poverty in the UK.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">We now look forward to working with <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> as it takes this process forward and ensuring that the UK has a measure of poverty that can be used to improve policy making.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The department will work with the Social Metrics Commission and other experts, including other government departments, to develop the new statistics.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"more-information\">More information</h2>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://socialmetricscommission.org.uk/\">Social Metrics Commission</a> is an independent commission dedicated to helping policy makers and the public understand and take action on poverty.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press Office</h2>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release – 020 3267 5126</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a> </li>\n  <li>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a> </li>\n  <li>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a> </li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-05-17T09:58:45.397Z"}]},"document_status":"scheduled","created_by":"Joe Brown","last_updated_by":"Catherine Destivelle","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true}}
