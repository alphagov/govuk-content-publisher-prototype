Department of Health and Social Care is setting up a service to deliver urgent medicines and medical products into the UK within 1 to 4 days as part of Brexit preparations.","details":{"body":"<p>The Department of Health and Social Care is strengthening its Brexit preparations with a £25 million contract to set up an express freight service to deliver medicines and medical products into the country.</p>\n\n<p>The department is leading a procurement exercise for an express freight service as part of the government’s plans to support continuity of supply when the UK leaves the EU on 31 October.</p>\n\n<p>The service is intended to deliver small parcels of medicines or medical products on a 24-hour basis, with additional provision to move larger pallet quantities on a 2- to 4-day basis. The service will be available to the whole of the UK.</p>\n\n<p>While the majority of goods will be standard medicines and medical products, the express freight service can also deliver temperature-controlled products if needed.</p>\n\n<p>The contract will run for 12 months, with a possible further 12-month extension.</p>\n\n<p>The contract notice has been published in the  <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ted.europa.eu/TED/notice/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:344963-2019:TEXT:EN:HTML\">Official Journal of the European Union</a> and potential bidders have until 21 August to submit proposals. The successful provider(s) are expected to be announced in September.</p>\n\n<p>The taxpayer will only be liable for up to around £4 million of the total value of the contract, but it is expected to be much less than this.</p>\n\n<p>The service will provide an additional level of contingency as part of necessary preparations to leave the EU on 31 October whatever the circumstances, supported by an additional £2 billion from the Treasury across government.</p>\n\n<p>This money includes £434 million to help ensure continuity of vital medicines and medical products through freight capacity, warehousing and stockpiling.</p>\n\n<p>The new service will support existing plans already in place, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>building buffer stocks of medicines and medical products</li>\n  <li>changing or clarifying regulatory requirements so that companies can continue to sell their products in the UK if we have no deal</li>\n  <li>strengthening the process and resources used to deal with shortages</li>\n  <li>procuring additional warehouse capacity</li>\n  <li>supporting companies to improve the readiness of their logistics and supply chains to meet the new customs and border requirements for both import and export</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Health Minister Chris Skidmore said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I want to ensure that when we leave the EU at the end of October, all appropriate steps have been taken to ensure frontline services are fully prepared.</p>\n\n  <p>That’s why we are stepping up preparations and strengthening our already extremely resilient contingency plans.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">This express freight service sends a clear message to the public that our plans should ensure supply of medical goods remains uninterrupted as we leave the EU.</p>\n</blockquote>\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d550c2ee5274a087013fe5e/close-up-of-pharmacist-s-working-in-the-nelson-pharmacy.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d550c2eed915d08d1046253/close-up-of-pharmacist-s-working-in-the-nelson-pharmacy.jpg","alt_text":"2 pharmacists working at a counter","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-08-14T16:24:18.577Z"}]},"document_status":"submitted_for_review","created_by":"Melissa Arnot Reid","last_updated_by":"Arunima Sinha","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
