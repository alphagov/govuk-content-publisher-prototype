For many, itâ€™s when kids start school that mums â€“ and dads â€“ look to get their careers back on track.Â </p>\n\n  <p>Still wanting to put your kids first often means work comes second â€“ it has to fit your life and work for your family.</p>\n\n  <p>So finding good, flexible work is so important â€“ which is why Iâ€™m making it easier.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">I want parents to know that Iâ€™m backing them, by ensuring that when they want to work, opportunities are available that fit into the world of the breakfast rush, packed lunches and school run.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Chair of the Womenâ€™s Business Council, Ms Fiona Dawson said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a working mum, I know myself how tricky it can be to balance the many demands faced by millions of women on a daily basis.</p>\n\n  <p>That is why at the Womenâ€™s Business Council, we have been looking into waysÂ of supporting women who want to balance work with not just raising a family, but the huge variety of seemingly conflicting priorities,Â and this portal will do just that.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">From staggered hours, to flexi-time and remote working, we are trying to help allÂ womenÂ find out about the flexible working options available to them,Â allowing them to balance their priorities in a way which works.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"case-study--vickys-story\">Case study â€“ Vickyâ€™s story</h2>\n\n<p>Vicky was out of work for nine-and-a-half years due to mental health issues and looking after her children. A change came when she enrolled in an employment programme called Youth Engineering.</p>\n\n<p>Of returning to work Vicky said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Getting back into work has improved my mental health dramatically. I thought I wasnâ€™t capable, but apparently I am. Iâ€™m going out and doing something for myself whereas before I wasnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve got a full time job, my kids are proud of me.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Iâ€™m proud of myself and Iâ€™ve never said that before.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To hear more from Vicky, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mywayin.campaign.gov.uk\">My Way In campaign</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press Office</h2>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release â€“ 020 3267 5144</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only â€“ not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow DWP on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></li>\n</ul>\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-08-30T12:54:09.587Z"}]},"document_status":"published","created_by":"Chris Sharma","last_updated_by":"Don Whillans","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":false},"document_schema":"news"}
