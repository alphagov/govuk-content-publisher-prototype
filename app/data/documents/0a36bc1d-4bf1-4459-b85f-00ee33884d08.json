For many, it’s when kids start school that mums – and dads – look to get their careers back on track. </p>\n\n  <p>Still wanting to put your kids first often means work comes second – it has to fit your life and work for your family.</p>\n\n  <p>So finding good, flexible work is so important – which is why I’m making it easier.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">I want parents to know that I’m backing them, by ensuring that when they want to work, opportunities are available that fit into the world of the breakfast rush, packed lunches and school run.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Chair of the Women’s Business Council, Ms Fiona Dawson said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a working mum, I know myself how tricky it can be to balance the many demands faced by millions of women on a daily basis.</p>\n\n  <p>That is why at the Women’s Business Council, we have been looking into ways of supporting women who want to balance work with not just raising a family, but the huge variety of seemingly conflicting priorities, and this portal will do just that.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">From staggered hours, to flexi-time and remote working, we are trying to help all women find out about the flexible working options available to them, allowing them to balance their priorities in a way which works.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"case-study--vickys-story\">Case study – Vicky’s story</h2>\n\n<p>Vicky was out of work for nine-and-a-half years due to mental health issues and looking after her children. A change came when she enrolled in an employment programme called Youth Engineering.</p>\n\n<p>Of returning to work Vicky said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Getting back into work has improved my mental health dramatically. I thought I wasn’t capable, but apparently I am. I’m going out and doing something for myself whereas before I wasn’t. I’ve got a full time job, my kids are proud of me.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">I’m proud of myself and I’ve never said that before.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To hear more from Vicky, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mywayin.campaign.gov.uk\">My Way In campaign</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press Office</h2>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release – 020 3267 5144</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow DWP on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></li>\n</ul>\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-08-30T12:54:09.587Z"}]},"document_status":"published","created_by":"Chris Sharma","last_updated_by":"Don Whillans","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":false},"document_schema":"news"}
