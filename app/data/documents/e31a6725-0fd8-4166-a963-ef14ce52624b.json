than 363,000 pensioners living in the EU will receive letters reassuring them their UK State Pension will continue to be paid when we leave the EU.","details":{"body":"<p>The government is sending out letters outlining that even if we leave without a deal, pensions for those in the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> will be uprated for a further 3 years – an increase of at least 2.5% annually for the duration of this Parliament, worth up to £200 a year per person.</p>\n\n<p>And pensioners will be told they do not need to do anything to continue receiving their State Pension.</p>\n\n<p>During the 3-year period, the UK government plans to negotiate a new arrangement with the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> to ensure that uprating continues.</p>\n\n<p>Work and Pensions Secretary Dr Thérèse Coffey said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Pensioners in Europe who have paid into the system for years deserve peace of mind over their future finances.</p>\n\n  <p>Not only are we providing much-needed reassurance for hundreds of thousands of retirees, we’re ensuring we are fully prepared for leaving the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> on 31 October.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">No matter the circumstances of Brexit, we’ve made sure that pensioners do not need to take any action to continue receiving their hard-earned State Pension.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A new dedicated call centre team based in Newcastle has also been established in order to answer any questions from those affected.</p>\n\n<p>The uprating will also affect those living in the <abbr title=\"European Economic Area\">EEA</abbr> states and Switzerland.</p>\n\n<p>The letters will be sent next week.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press
