Chief Executive Loveday Ryder launches a series of updates on how we’re building a culture of innovation, learning, empowerment and purpose and what it’s like to work here at BPDTS.","details":{"body":"<h2 id=\"what-we-do\">What we do</h2>\n\n<p>Here at BPDTS we provide digital technology services to the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr>). Our digital, data and technology specialists work closely with experts across <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> Digital to help transform services used by millions of people each and every day.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"making-a-difference\">Making a difference</h2>\n\n<p>As public servants, the services we help deliver make a difference to people at critical times in their lives – as they look for work, deal with illness or disability, support children after separation, or plan for retirement. Operating on a large scale, our people use their expertise, diversity and passion to create effortless, secure and intuitive digital services.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-ways-of-working\">New ways of working</h2>\n\n<p>In return, we offer our people the chance to think big, try new ways of working and use their expertise to deliver change on a massive scale. The way we work is as vital as what we do. We aim to be an organisation with a distinctive culture and feel – making the most of the public service culture we share with the civil service and blending it with the flexibility and opportunities we have as a new and evolving company.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"culture-and-values\">Culture and values</h2>\n\n<p>At BPDTS, we recognise that organisational culture is vital for the success of our company, our customers and our people. We’re involving all our colleagues in the process to shape our culture, with a focus on key themes including customer value, leadership, community, organisational identity, development and career progression. Everything we do is underpinned by our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/822300/bpdts-about-us.pdf\">POISE values (Pride, Opportunity, Inclusivity, Simplicity and Expertise)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We want to continue to thrive and adapt to change over the coming years and ensure we have highly-motivated colleagues as well as attracting the best people to join us in the future.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sharing-lifeatbpdts\">Sharing #LifeatBPDTS</h2>\n\n<p>We’ve come a long way since we began in 2016 and we’ve grown rapidly over the last 12 months. We’re rightly proud of what we’ve achieved and we want to tell our story. Over the next few months BPDTS colleagues will share updates on how we’re building a culture of innovation, learning, empowerment and purpose and what it’s like to work here.</p>\n\n<p>We’ll focus on how we’re working together to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>shape our culture</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>work smarter to deliver the best outcomes</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>champion diversity and inclusion</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>develop all our people as leaders</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>put colleagues’ health and wellbeing at the forefront of all we do</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>make a difference to charities near our digital hubs through volunteering</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We’ll be posting here on GOV.UK and also sharing via social media using #LifeatBPDTS.
