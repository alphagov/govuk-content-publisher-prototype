Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is launching phase 2 of its campaign to get more people working in adult social care, with a focus on 20 to 39 year olds.","details":{"body":"<p>The next phase of DHSC’s campaign  <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.everydayisdifferent.com/home.aspx\">‘When you care, every day makes a difference’</a> aims to help fill the 122,000 vacancies in adult social care.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-campaign-to-recruit-thousands-more-adult-social-care-staff\">The campaign was first launched in February</a> to attract new people with the right values to the sector and increase interest in adult social care as a vocation.</p>\n\n<p>It will continue to target 20 to 39 year olds, raising awareness of the benefits of a career in adult social care.</p>\n\n<p>The department’s recent survey of 2,020 adults showed that people in England aged 18 to 34 are the most likely to consider applying for a job in adult social care.</p>\n\n<p>The survey showed that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>64% of 18 to 34 year olds would consider a career in adult social care</li>\n  <li>over half of people aged 18 to 34 would consider changing career for a job that helps or supports others</li>\n  <li>more than 1 in 10 people aged 18 to 34 are dissatisfied with their current job</li>\n  <li>59% would consider moving roles to a job that offers more personal fulfilment</li>\n  <li>65% of parents with dependent children would consider a role in adult social care</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Nearly 1.5 million people work in the adult social care sector, but an ageing population means that 580,000 more workers will be needed by 2035.</p>\n\n<p>The average age of those working in the sector is 45 years old, and around 385,000 jobs are held by people aged 55 years old who are likely to retire in the next 10 years.</p>\n\n<p>Roles in adult social care include working with adults of all ages in different locations and with different needs, for example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a care worker in a care or nursing home</li>\n  <li>an activities co-ordinator in the local community</li>\n  <li>an occupational therapist in a hospital</li>\n  <li>a personal assistant in someone’s home</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Minister for Care Caroline Dinenage said:</p>\n\n<p>“A career in adult social care offers the rewarding opportunity to make a real difference to the lives of some of the most vulnerable people in society – a sentiment 96% of current care workers on the ground agree with.</p>\n\n<p>“We have over a million brilliant people working in the sector, but we urgently need new talent to ensure we can continue to provide support for those who need it.</p>\n\n<p>“I hope our ‘When you care, every day makes a difference’ campaign will draw more people with the right values to forge fulfilling careers and help them realise how diverse, worthwhile and often flexible jobs in social care can be. I urge anyone considering a career in care to apply today.” </p>\n\n<p>Julie Ogley, President of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS), said:</p>\n\n<p>“People of any age can work in social care and make a real difference to the lives of so many who need it.</p>\n\n<p>“There’s a wealth of highly rewarding career opportunities for everyone, from providing vital care and support as a care worker or personal assistant, to roles in the local community and beyond with the opportunity to go further.</p>\n\n<p>“There are careers to be had in social care – our own members, all of whom are directors, and their direct line reports, are a prime example of this.</p>\n\n<p>“We want to see a social care workforce that is diverse and well representative of our society and we hope that this campaign will help us to achieve that.”</p>\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5da5e4c0e5274a3922a61724/adult-social-care-recruitment-campaign-1.png","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5da5e4bded915d17ac2182bb/adult-social-care-recruitment-campaign-1.png","alt_text":"A social care worker laughing with her client","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-10-15T15:54:08.446Z"}]},"document_status":"published","created_by":"Alex Honnold","last_updated_by":"Tashi Malik","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true}}
