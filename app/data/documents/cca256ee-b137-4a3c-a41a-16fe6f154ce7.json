Alongside airport-style scanners, metal detectors and phone blockers, we will crack down on those who continue to commit crime and wreak havoc in our jails.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The new technology will identify perpetrators more quickly and produce improved digital evidence that is more likely to bring a successful prosecution in court.</p>\n\n<p>It will also offer opportunities to gather intelligence on how phones are being used to commit crime and detect and disrupt criminal activity in the wider community.</p>\n\n<p>The specialist digital forensics team is being funded from the government’s previously announced £2.75 billion package to transform the prison estate. This includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>£100 million to bolster prison security – with the new digital forensics facility, alongside tough airport-style security and phone-blocking technology to clampdown on violence, self-harm and crime behind bars.</li>\n  <li>£2.5 billion to provide 10,000 additional prison places and create modern, efficient jails that rehabilitate offenders, reduce reoffending and keep the public safe.</li>\n  <li>£156 million for pressing maintenance to create safe and decent conditions for offender rehabilitation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"notes-to-editors\">Notes to editors</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>More than 20,000 mobile devices and SIM cards are seized in prisons each year. The number of smartphones seized is also growing – with 1 in 3 phones examined by the Prison Service now having these capabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5db6d4a1ed915d1d0684fe00/tech-asset.png","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5db6d49fe5274a4aa3db0720/tech-asset.png","alt_text":"Digital binary code","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-10-28T11:46:21.481Z"}]},"document_status":"draft","created_by":"Reinhold Messner","last_updated_by":"Stefan Glowatz","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true}}
