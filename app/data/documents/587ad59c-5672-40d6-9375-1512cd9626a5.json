travelling to the Middle East remains very low and <abbr title=\"Public Health England\">PHE</abbr>, NaTHNaC and the World Health Organization do not currently advise any travel restrictions to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (<abbr title=\"Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\">KSA</abbr>) in relation to <abbr title=\"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus\">MERS-CoV</abbr>. Â </p>\n\n<p>We urge pilgrims returning from Hajj and Umrah to look out for these symptoms:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>fever</li>\n  <li>coughing</li>\n  <li>shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If individuals experience these symptoms within 14 days of leaving the Middle East, they should call their <abbr title=\"general practitioner (family doctor)\">GP</abbr> immediately or NHS 111 and mention their travel history.</p>\n\n<p>However, Saudi Arabia has reported over 150 cases across the country since January 2019, occurring mainly among <abbr title=\"Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\">KSA</abbr> residents. There is growing evidence that camels can be a source of infection. <abbr title=\"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus\">MERS-CoV</abbr> can also spread person-to-person if there is close contact.
