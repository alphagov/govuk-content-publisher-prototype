McNally, Events and Engagement Co-ordinator and MADE representative for Manchester, BPDTS Ltd, on our work to volunteer and fundraise for local charities.","details":{"body":"<h2 id=\"making-a-difference-to-everyone\">Making a Difference to Everyone</h2>\n<p>Here at BPDTS, we’re lucky enough to have colleagues who are happy to give something back and help where it’s needed, a true testament to our sense of community and the people we work with on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve set up our <abbr title=\"Make a Difference to Everyone\">MADE</abbr> programme (Make a Difference to Everyone) to partner with some fabulous charities from around the UK. We’re committed to volunteering our time and helping to raise as much money as possible for them over the next 12 months.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-were-doing-this\">How we’re doing this</h2>\n\n<p>We’ve set up a working group with representatives from across BPDTS Ltd to give advice and support on how our colleagues can support charities local to our Hub locations in Newcastle, Manchester, Blackpool, Leeds and Sheffield.</p>\n\n<p>At BPDTS, colleagues are encouraged to take time out of the office to volunteer. Our <abbr title=\"Make a Difference to Everyone\">MADE</abbr> group helps coordinate activity to help people make best use of their volunteer days. We also run fundraising activities to help our chosen charities throughout the year – one charity is chosen by colleagues in each of our locations.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, we aim to make being part of BPDTS more than just about “the day job” as we try and make a difference to people in the areas around each hub.</p>\n\n<p>Our enthusiastic volunteers are based in each location supporting these organisations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Newcastle Dog &amp; Cat Shelter</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Trinity Hospice in Blackpool</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>St Leonard’s Hospice in Leeds</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation trust</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The Christie in Manchester</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Huge thanks to all our representatives: Judith Trotter, Louise Wilson-Lee, Rebecca Ganchi, Nicola Erskine Sephton, Muzaffar Ibrahim and David Johnson.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"made-in-manchester\">\n<abbr title=\"Make a Difference to Everyone\">MADE</abbr> in Manchester</h2>\n\n<p>I’m Jordan, the <abbr title=\"Make a Difference to Everyone\">MADE</abbr> representative here in the Manchester Hub. In Manchester we’re proud to have chosen The Christie as our charity of the year.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d95f748ed915d399f3a252d/jordan-mcnally.jpg\" alt=\"Jordan McNally\"></div>\n<figcaption><p>Jordan McNally</p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>As part of our commitment, I got the chance to take a look around The Christie with their wonderful fundraising manager who told me all about the benefits of becoming a corporate partner.</p>\n\n<p>The Christie is the largest single site cancer centre in Europe, treating more than 44,000 patients a year. Based in Manchester, they are the leading experts in cancer care, research and education and have been pioneering cancer research breakthroughs for over 100 years.</p>\n\n<p>This work would not be possible without the generosity of others and neither would the lifesaving hope it provides to their patients and their families.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-this-matters\">Why this matters</h2>\n\n<p>They have achieved so much since a group of philanthropists joined forces in 1890 with a vision for a centre of excellence for cancer care. Thanks to their dedicated staff and those who have believed in them since, they continue to remain at the forefront of cancer care and research. They’re dedicated to providing better outcomes to those affected by cancer, both now and in the future.</p>\n\n<p>The Christie Charity supports the work of the Christie NHS Foundation Trust through its fundraising activities, and delivers projects, equipment and improvements in addition to those funded by the NHS. Without the commitment of their fantastic fundraisers, they would not be able to provide their patients and their families with the level of care and support that they deserve in such a desperate time.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d95f79140f0b6174cf41212/christie.jpg\" alt=\"The Chrsitie charity box and flags\"></div>\n<figcaption><p>The Christie charity box and flags</p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>The continued and unflagging passion, commitment and loyalty from their army of supporters allows them to go above and beyond for Christie’s patients, providing them with the very best treatment and care.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>For me, the fact that Manchester has chosen The Christie as its chosen charity is quite heart-warming. My auntie is being treated at The Christie for a rare type of lung cancer, so I know first-hand what fabulous work they are doing to help the lives of their patients and their families.</p>\n\n<p>We’re looking forward to raising money for such a good cause, and with the help of BPDTS and the people that work here, I’m sure we can help make a massive difference to a truly deserving cause.</p>\n\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d95f6f640f0b6174e96e6ef/made.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d95f6f5ed915d39ac326fbd/made.jpg","alt_text":"Making a difference for everyone logo","caption":"MADE ","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-10-03T13:38:50.496Z"}]},"document_status":"published_but_needs_2i","created_by":"Junko Tabei","last_updated_by":"Alison Hargreaves","political":false,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true}}
