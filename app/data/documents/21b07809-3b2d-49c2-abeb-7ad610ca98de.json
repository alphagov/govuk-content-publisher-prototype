CMA has found that Rentokil Initialâ€™s takeover of Mitie Pest Control may restrict choice and lead to higher prices for customers.","details":{"body":"<p>Market leader Rentokil completed the takeover of its close rival Mitie in September 2018. The firms are 2 of the leading suppliers of pest control services in the UK to commercial customers.</p>\n\n<p>After opening an investigation into the merger, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has today issued its phase 1 decision. Having considered a wide range of evidence, it has found there could be a substantial reduction in competition, which may lead to higher prices or reduced quality for customers that primarily use a single provider across the whole or a large part of the UK.</p>\n\n<p>This is because Rentokil and Mitie are 2 of the 4 major suppliers at this level, with a large combined market share. The CMA has found that it is unlikely that other companies will expand or enter the market in a timely manner and offset the loss of competition caused by the merger.</p>\n\n<p>Rentokil must now offer proposals to address these concerns by 23 April or face an in-depth Phase 2 investigation into the merger.</p>\n\n<p>Further details are available on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/rentokil-initial-plc-mpcl-limited-formerly-mitie-pest-control-limited-merger-inquiry\">investigation case page</a>.</p>\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5caf3e4a40f0b615c3008580/istock-858263694.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5caf3e4940f0b615c4ed9e30/istock-858263694.jpg","alt_text":"Pest control equipment being used","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-04-12T05:41:27.737Z"}]},"document_status":"published","created_by":"Tamae Watanabe","last_updated_by":"Arunima Sinha","political":false,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
