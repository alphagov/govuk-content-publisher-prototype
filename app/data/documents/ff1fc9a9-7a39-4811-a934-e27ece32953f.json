Land Registry’s digital Local Land Charges Register continues to grow, enabling the digital transformation of homebuying.","details":{"body":"<p>From 1 October 2019, anyone requiring Local Land Charges (LLC) searches in the local authority area of Lambeth will need to get them from HM Land Registry rather than going directly to the council.</p>\n\n<p>Lambeth Council is migrating its Local Land Charges data to HM Land Registry’s national register. They are in the forefront of local authorities leading the use of digital transformation to make buying a home simpler and quicker.</p>\n\n<p>Councillor Andy Wilson, Lambeth Council’s Cabinet Member for Finance, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Lambeth is the fourth most densely populated borough in London which means we have a huge variety of different kinds of charges, both residential and commercial. These include many world-famous tourist attractions such as the London Eye, the Imperial War Museum and Lambeth Palace. We are pleased to be at the forefront of this digital transformation which will help speed up property transactions for all customers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Karina Singh, Director of Transformation at HM Land Registry, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Colleagues at Lambeth Council and HM Land Registry have worked closely together to migrate their complex and large dataset to our national digital LLC Register. The transfer of Lambeth’s service marks a significant milestone in the government’s ambition to make homebuying faster, simpler and cheaper for everyone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Local land charges searches are normally required in the property-buying process. Most local land charges are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of the property such as planning permissions or listed buildings. The local land charges search will reveal whether a property is subject to a charge which then informs a buyer’s decision to buy a property or parcel of land.</p>\n\n<p>HM Land Registry is working in partnership with a number of local authorities in England to migrate their Local Land Charges data to a central, digital register as part of a phased approach. Once migrated, anyone will be able to get instant online search results via GOV.UK using the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://search-local-land-charges.service.gov.uk/\">Search for Local Land Charges</a>  service.</p>\n\n<p>HM Land Registry’s business customers can use their existing portal and Business Gateway channels or their usual search providers to access Local Land Charges data for those local authorities which have migrated.</p>\n\n<p>Customers will need to continue to submit CON29 enquiries to the local authority.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"watch-a-video-about-the-local-land-charges-service\">Watch a video about the Local Land Charges service</h3>\n\n<p>For an overview of the service, watch <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM5jbQiU1c4\">our short video.</a></p>\n\n<p>For more information, read about the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-land-registry-local-land-charges-programme/local-land-charges-programme\">Local Land Charges Programme</a>.</p>\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d91e96de5274a2fb39c8957/london-eye-arkadiusz-radek-unsplashlkd.png","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d91e96be5274a2faf08cd36/london-eye-arkadiusz-radek-unsplashlkd.png","alt_text":"view of the London eye from across the Thames","caption":"","credit":"London Eye arkadiusz-radek-unsplashLKD"},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-09-30T11:45:10.923Z"}]},"document_status":"scheduled","created_by":"Joe Brown","last_updated_by":"Stefan Glowatz","political":false,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true}}
