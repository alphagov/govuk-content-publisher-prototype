record number of disabled people have been supported by the Access to Work scheme, as new figures reveal 36,240 people received the life-changing grant last year.","details":{"body":"<p>Government spending on the Access to Work scheme is up to record levels, with £129.1 million spent last year – a real terms increase of £15 million since 2010.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work\">Access to Work</a> is a government-run scheme that breaks down workplace barriers for disabled people and those with health conditions by paying for adjustments such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>specialist equipment</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>support workers</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>travel to work</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>sign language interpreters</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>People can receive almost £60,000 a year through the scheme, which is more than double the average annual salary and an increase of 40% in just 2 years.</p>\n\n<p>Minister for Disabled People Justin Tomlinson said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Having a disability or health condition must not be a barrier to enjoying a fulfilling career – and the support available means there’s no excuse for employers who refuse to be inclusive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Access to Work removes the obstacles facing disabled people in the workplace, helping to level the playing field and ensure businesses don’t see employing disabled people as a burden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">With more disabled people than ever before supported through Access to Work, thousands more employers across the country are benefitting from the skills disabled people bring to the workplace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Access to Work is part of a wider government drive to create more job opportunities for disabled people, with nearly 950,000 more disabled people in work compared to 5 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has committed to reviewing the government’s goal to see one million more disabled people in work between 2017 and 2027 with a view to making the target more ambitious.</p>\n\n<p>Ross is a wheelchair user who works for Lloyds Banking Group. He has a support worker to help with workplace tasks, paid for by Access to Work.</p>\n\n<p>Ross said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Access to Work has made a massive difference to my life. Without it, I wouldn’t have a job. I probably wouldn’t be earning a living, I wouldn’t own my own home, I wouldn’t be able to go on holidays and I wouldn’t be able to follow the hobbies that interest me because I wouldn’t be able to be employed. It makes a massive, massive difference to me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Louis, who is visually impaired, also works for Lloyds Banking Group. Access to Work has paid for taxi fares so that Louis and his guide dog Dexter can get to and from work safely.</p>\n\n<p>Louis said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Access to Work is that key enabler which allows businesses to be as inclusive as they want to be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p>Read the latest <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/access-to-work-statistics-april-2007-to-march-2019\">Access to Work statistics</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release – 020 3267 5126</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow DWP on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-08-07T09:20:45.741Z"}]},"document_status":"published","created_by":"Margo Hayes","last_updated_by":"Pasang Lhamu","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
