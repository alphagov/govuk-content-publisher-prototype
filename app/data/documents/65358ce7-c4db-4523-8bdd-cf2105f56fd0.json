These figures show the huge progress being made under this government to help them realise their aspirations.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">While we have made great gains so far, today I am calling on all businesses to take a look at their record on disability employment and think about what they can do to help create a more equal Britain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thousands of businesses – including major employers such as Sainsbury’s and GlaxoSmithKline – have already signed up to the scheme.</p>\n\n<p>Changes being rolled out imminently include requiring Disability Confident Leader businesses to publicly report on their disability employment using a Voluntary Reporting Framework and extending membership for new signups to 3 years, and changing the terms of membership to make it explicit senior members must employ disabled people.</p>\n\n<p>Minister for Disabled People Justin Tomlinson said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Disability Confident and the success of the New Enterprise Allowance scheme reflect our bold commitment to get one million more disabled people into work by 2027.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Smart employers recognise that disabled people can bring a wealth of skills and talents to an organisation – and they’re making sure they’re not missing out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To date 15,000 businesses have joined Disability Confident.</p>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p>Find out more about the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://disabilityconfident.campaign.gov.uk/?utm_source=Press&amp;utm_medium=SoSOpEd&amp;utm_term=3rdAnniversary&amp;utm_campaign=DC\">Disability Confident scheme</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press Office</h2>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release – 020 3267 5106</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow DWP on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dbc3abced915d1d0c3b7efa/disability-confident-960.gif","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dbc3abc40f0b6379ee2b4e6/disability-confident-960.gif","alt_text":"Disability Confident logo","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-11-01T14:30:09.067Z"},{"note":"Removed inaccuracy stating leading Disability Confident  employers would have a requirement to report how many disabled people are on their payroll.","public_timestamp":"2019-11-05T12:42:23.270Z"}]},"document_status":"published_but_needs_2i","created_by":"Melissa Arnot Reid","last_updated_by":"Lynn Hill","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
