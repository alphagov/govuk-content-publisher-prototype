The pilot service will show them exactly what new skills they need to move into higher-paid roles available near them.</p>\n\n<p>Work and Pensions Secretary Dr Thérèse Coffey said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I want to give everyone the best start in life, and every chance to get not just a job, but find that dream job. </p>\n\n  <p>That is why we will provide extra help for disadvantaged young people and use the latest technology to help people climb the career ladder.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">We’ve seen 3.7 million more people in work since 2010 and wages outpacing inflation for a year and a half now, but I want to ensure we’re always looking at new ways to help anyone no matter the barriers they face into a good job.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Both pilots could then be rolled out nationwide, helping reduce youth unemployment further after it fell 48% since 2010, and helping more people boost their earnings after new data this month showed average pay rising by its fastest rate in a decade.</p>\n\n<p>Latest data released in September shows UK employment has increased by 3.7 million since 2010. Around three-quarters of that increase in employment has come from full-time, permanent and higher skilled roles.</p>\n\n<p>Youth unemployment has also halved since 2010, with 451,000 more young people in work. The number of children growing up in workless households is also at an all-time low. </p>\n\n<p>Income inequality is at its lowest for 30 years as wages grew by 4% in July, outpacing inflation for 18 months in a row.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press Office</h2>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release – 020 3267 5144</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-09-30T11:08:27.880Z"}]},"document_status":"published","created_by":"Angela Eiter","last_updated_by":"Jaahnavi Sriperambuduru","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
