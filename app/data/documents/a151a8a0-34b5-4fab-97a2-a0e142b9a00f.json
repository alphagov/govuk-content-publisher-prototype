than £374 million to be invested in essential infrastructure for new homes.","details":{"body":"<p>The Housing Secretary has today announced a further 5 successful Housing Infrastructure Fund projects, as the government’s infrastructure revolution to unlock more homes continues.</p>\n\n<p>From Swindon to Cornwall, more than £374 million will be invested in roads, schools, public transport and utilities, ensuring homes can be built in the areas where they are needed the most.</p>\n\n<p>Housing Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">This government is committed to building the homes this country needs, so that more people can realise the dream of owning their own home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">This £374 million funding will ensure that communities have the right infrastructure to enable new homes to be built, such as road and transport improvements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Minister of State for Housing Rt Hon Esther McVey MP said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">We are investing record amounts in roads, rail, housing and broadband to ensure Britain has the modern infrastructure needed to thrive, and to allow local economies to flourish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As part of the government’s commitment to levelling up communities so they can take full advantage of economic growth and prosper, the 5 schemes in Swindon, Wiltshire, Cornwall, North Somerset and Medway are expected to unlock up to 32,000 homes.</p>\n\n<p>Today’s news means that since 2018, this
