prisoner escort contracts have been awarded which will see the introduction of a modern fleet of vehicles and innovative monitoring technology.","details":{"body":"<p>The revised contracts for the Prisoner Escort and Custody Service (PECS) will build on the current arrangements within England and Wales - introducing an updated fleet of escort vehicles with enhanced safety and security features, and an innovative digital platform which provides real-time data on the location of detainees and prisoners who are being moved.</p>\n\n<p>These changes will improve the efficiency of the PECS service as well as overall safety, security and decency for prisoners. They will also realise significant benefits during the 10-year term of the contracts such as reducing the number of delays at court, stopping mixed transportation of adult and youths and minimising the time a prisoner spends in a court cell or prison van.</p>\n\n<p>The contracts were awarded following a competitive procedure. GEOAmey Ltd and Serco Ltd offered the best overall bids in terms of quality and cost and the contracts will start from 29 August 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Performance will be monitored through monthly meetings to ensure high standards are maintained and suppliers are held to account.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"notes-to-editors\">Notes to editors</h3>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>PECS provides the safe and secure transport of prisoners, including: adults; children and young people to and from Police Stations; Courts; Prisons; Secure Training Centres (STCs); and Secure Childrenâ€™s Schools (SCHs)</li>\n  <li>PECS has been managed by private sector providers since 1994. The fourth generation of contracts will commence 29 August 2020.</li>\n  <li>Serco Ltd has been selected to provide the service across the whole of the South of England region and GeoAmey PECS Ltd will cover the North region.</li>\n  <li>For further information please contact the Ministry of Justice press office on 0203 334 3536.</li>\n</ol>\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5db86fc0ed915d1d05dfb79f/pecs-serco-960x640.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5db86fbfed915d1d09ae441b/pecs-serco-960x640.jpg","alt_text":"Prisoner escort contracts awarded","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-10-29T16:58:40.655Z"}]},"document_status":"scheduled","created_by":"Margo Hayes","last_updated_by":"Lynn Hill","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true}}
