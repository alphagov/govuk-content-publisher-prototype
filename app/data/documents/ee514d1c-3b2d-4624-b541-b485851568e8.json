trailblazing projects across the country are set to receive £3 million of new funding.","details":{"body":"<p>Sixteen trailblazing projects across the country are set to receive £3 million of new funding to support innovative approaches to integration, Communities Minister Lord Bourne confirmed today (20 May 2019).</p>\n\n<p>From a community gardening project in south-west London that helps new migrants to practice their English language skills while learning how to cultivate land, to table tennis clubs to be run across 3 housing estates in Brighton, the government’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/integrated-communities-innovation-fund\">Integrated Communities Innovation Fund</a> will help drive forward projects to tackle the causes of poor integration.</p>\n\n<p>Delivered in partnership with Sport England, the Fund will engage 70,000 people with activities in schools, community and leisure centres, and in partnership with businesses, local authorities and housing associations.</p>\n\n<p>The Communities Minister made the announcement while visiting the Blackfriars Settlement in London which is running a project to encourage social mixing through pop-up ‘friendliness cafes’.</p>\n\n<p>Communities Minister, Lord Bourne said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Britain is on the whole a well-integrated society, but we know that too many people are still locked out of the benefits that come with full participation in society.</p>\n\n  <p>To tackle the root causes of poor integration we need to bring together people from all backgrounds and from all parts of society, from business leaders to grassroots charities.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">That is why we have partnered with Sport England to fund 16 trailblazing projects that seek to bridge divides and bring communities together in bold and innovative ways.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Government will fund 14 projects across the country, while Sport England will fund 2 projects in Birmingham and Brighton.</p>\n\n<p>Tim Hollingsworth, Chief Executive, Sport England said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sport England is proud to be working with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government to help integrate communities up and down the country.</p>\n\n  <p>Not only does taking part in sport and physical activity have powerful mental and physical health benefits, it can help people develop new skills and bring them together in a shared experience.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">We look forward to working with the projects as they help people feel more connected to their communities and society as a whole.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Today’s announcement is part of the government’s ongoing work to tackle the causes of poor integration, including working with 5 integration areas across England: Blackburn with Darwen; Bradford; Peterborough; Walsall; and Waltham Forest, who have produced their own ambitious local integration plans.</p>\n\n<p>The government is committing at total of £2,747,722.
