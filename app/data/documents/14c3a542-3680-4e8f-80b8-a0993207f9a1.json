research has revealed the stunning impact of the government’s flagship automatic enrolment policy in transforming Britain’s saving habits.","details":{"body":"<p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (<abbr title=\"Institute for Fiscal Studies\">IFS</abbr>) found the revolutionary reform had brought almost half of the country’s small business workforce into workplace pensions, increasing participation rates by a huge 44%.</p>\n\n<p>With more than a quarter of private sector employees in the UK working for a small business, the figures shine a light on how automatic enrolment is improving the pension prospects of millions of people.</p>\n\n<p>While fewer than 1 in 6 of these workers were saving for retirement before automatic enrolment was introduced in 2012, that figure has now reached 7 in 10. The <abbr title=\"Institute for Fiscal Studies\">IFS</abbr> study asserts that just 26% of small business workers would have been saving into a workplace pension today without the dawn of automatic enrolment.</p>\n\n<p>The research also revealed 91% of private sector employees work for an employer that offers a workplace pension.</p>\n\n<p>Minister for Pensions and Financial Inclusion Guy Opperman said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Automatic enrolment has been an extraordinary success, transforming pension saving and improving the retirement prospects of more than 10 million workers already.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">As this report shows, small business owners all over the UK have made this possible, with participation rates estimated to have been increased from 26% to 70% due to automatic enrolment. This radical reform is creating a new relationship between the employee and their employer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This government is committed to making sure that small business owners throughout UK are able to thrive and grow.</p>\n\n<p>Official research shows that 70% of small and micro employers found the ongoing administration of their workplace pension scheme easy.</p>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p>Read the <abbr title=\"Institute for Fiscal Studies\">IFS</abbr> report <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14013\">Pensions for almost all: automatic enrolment for employees of small employers</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"more-information\">More information</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/employers-pension-provision-survey-2017\">Employers’ pension provision survey 2017</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/automatic-enrolment-quantitative-research-with-small-and-micro-employers\">Automatic enrolment: quantitative research with small and micro employers</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press Office</h2>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release – 020 3267 5115</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-04-10T10:59:33.468Z"}]},"document_status":"scheduled","created_by":"Sasha DiGiulian","last_updated_by":"Joe Brown","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
