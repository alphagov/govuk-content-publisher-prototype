employment is at a joint record high, wages surpass inflation for the 16th month in a row, record numbers are in work and unemployment continues to fall.","details":{"body":"<p>New statistics show wages are booming for UK workers, with regular pay rising 1.7% in real terms (above inflation) – meaning people’s earnings are rising at their fastest since October 2015.</p>\n\n<p>As 354,000 more people entered the workforce in the last year, female employment in the UK also continued to increase, remaining at its record high of 72.0%,</p>\n\n<p>New figures also show the level of  youth unemployment in the UK has nearly halved since 2010, falling by 47%.</p>\n\n<p>Overall the UK’s unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1974 at 3.8%, with female unemployment reaching a new record low of 3.6%. The largest fall in unemployment was also among people unemployed for over a year – showing the success of a reformed welfare system designed to help people overcome their personal barriers to work.</p>\n\n<p>Employment Minister Alok Sharma said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Wages outpacing inflation for 16 months in a row, more people in work than ever before and joint-record female employment, means better prospects for many thousands of UK families and shows the continued resilience of the UK labour market.</p>\n\n  <p>With unemployment still falling, remaining at its lowest level since 1974, its clear that UK employers continue to have confidence in our hard-working workforce.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">And with many schools breaking up this week there are some great opportunities for young people to get a taste of work over the summer  – boosting their CVs as well as their bank balances as they prepare for their future careers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Vacancies stood at 827,000 in March to May 2019, showing the continued willingness of UK employers to invest in new roles.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-press-office\">Contact Press Office</h2>\n\n<p>Media enquiries for this press release – 020 3267 5162</p>\n\n<div id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Press Office</h3>\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n    \n      <p class=\"adr\">\n<span class=\"street-address\">Caxton House\n<br>\nTothill Street</span><br>\n<span class=\"locality\">London</span><br>\n<span class=\"postal-code\">SW1H 9NA</span>\n</p>\n\n    \n    \n      <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n      \n      \n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">London Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims)</span>\n          020 3267 5144\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Out-of-hours (journalists only)</span>\n          07623 928 975\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">England and Wales (local media enquiries)</span>\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        </p>\n      \n        <p class=\"tel\">\n          <span class=\"type\">Scotland (local media enquiries)</span>\n          0131 310 1122\n        </p>\n      \n      </div>\n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Follow DWP on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\">Twitter</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\">Facebook</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\">YouTube</a></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-07-16T10:02:06.724Z"}]},"document_status":"draft","created_by":"Daila Ojeda","last_updated_by":"Adam Ondra","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true}}
