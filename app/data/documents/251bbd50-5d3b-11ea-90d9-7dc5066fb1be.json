In this guidance we give and in-depth explanation of the rules and the origin of the game.","details":{"body":"## How to play Simon Says Simon Says is the classic game that can be used anywhere from a day at the beach, to a long car ride or even a simple ice breaker. Listen closely as “Simon” gives you directions. If “Simon” says to do something, you better act fast. But, if “Simon” does not and you do it anyway, you’re out! ## Requires At least 3 people, but more people make for more fun ## Game play One person is designated Simon, the others are the players. Standing in front of the group, Simon tells players what they must do. However, the players must only obey commands that begin with the words “Simon Says.” If Simon says, “Simon says touch your nose,” then players must touch their nose. But, if Simon simply says, “jump,” without first saying “Simon says,” players must not jump. Those that do jump are out. ## Objective Follow directions and stay in the game for as long as possible! The last player standing wins and becomes the next Simon. If you’re Simon, the object is to try to dupe the players to follow your commands when they shouldn’t."},"updated_at":"2020-03-03T11:00:06.298Z","updated_by":"Simon Whatley"}
