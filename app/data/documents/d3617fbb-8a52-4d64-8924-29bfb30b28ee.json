Office for Disability Issues has announced the appointment of chairs to lead 9 new Regional Stakeholder Networks.","details":{"body":"<p>Regional chairs have been announced to move forward work to break down the barriers disabled people and their families face in everyday life.</p>\n\n<p>The appointees will lead 9 new Regional Stakeholder Networks tasked with amplifying the voices of disabled people and disability organisations in regions across England, reporting back to government on a range of issues including transport, housing and employment.</p>\n\n<p>The chairs of the network were selected based on their understanding of disability issues specific to their regions, their expertise in disability policy and its effects at the grassroots level.</p>\n\n<p>Minister for Disabled People Justin Tomlinson said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">If we are truly to break down the barriers faced by disabled people in everyday life, it’s vital that we  listen to their views.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">All the chairs have a wealth of experience, expertise and skills which qualify them for these crucial roles. I am delighted at the calibre of the successful candidates and looking forward to working with the Regional Stakeholder Network to drive change and improve the lives of disabled people across the country.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Many of the 8 chairs are disabled people, while others work in disabled people’s organisations or organisations that support disabled people.</p>\n\n<p>Several hold other roles in a voluntary capacity which will help them tap into the issues and concerns of their local networks.</p>\n\n<p>The chairs will convene meetings with network members within their regions and work with the government’s Office for Disability Issues to help inform future policy.</p>\n\n<p>The first meeting between the chairs is due to take place today.</p>\n\n<p>The Network chairs are:</p>\n\n<p>East of England: Naomi Tomkys <abbr title=\"Order of the British Empire\">OBE</abbr>, <abbr title=\"Chief Executive Officer\">CEO</abbr>, Sky Badger</p>\n\n<p>Greater London: Ruth Owen <abbr title=\"Order of the British Empire\">OBE</abbr>, <abbr title=\"Chief Executive Officer\">CEO</abbr>, Whizz-Kidz</p>\n\n<p>North East: Michael Potts, Board Member, Veterans Advisory and Pension Committee</p>\n\n<p>North West: Lynne Turnbull, <abbr title=\"Chief Executive Officer\">CEO</abbr>, Cheshire Centre for Independent Living</p>\n\n<p>South East: Barry Ginley, Director, Tamstone Consulting Ltd</p>\n\n<p>South West: Samantha Everard, <abbr title=\"Chief Executive Officer\">CEO</abbr>, Support and Mentoring Enabling Entrepreneurship (SAMEE)</p>\n\n<p>West and East Midlands: Louise Mckiernan, <abbr title=\"Chief Executive Officer\">CEO</abbr>, Birmingham Disability Resource Centre</p>\n\n<p>Yorkshire and the Humber: Liz Leach Murphy, Founder/Managing Director, Imagineer CIC</p>\n\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d9b5a7ae5274a59f73b99ba/odi-logo-960.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d9b5a7940f0b66859708607/odi-logo-960.jpg","alt_text":"Logo for the Office for Disability Issues","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-10-07T15:46:53.202Z"}]},"document_status":"draft","created_by":"Stephano Ghisolfi","last_updated_by":"Dean Potter","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
