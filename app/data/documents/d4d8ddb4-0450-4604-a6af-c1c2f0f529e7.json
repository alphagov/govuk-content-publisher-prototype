Environment Agency is inviting Kendal children, families and local residents to get involved in a family fun day during half term planting tree seeds and painting plant pots as part of their tree planting efforts through the Kendal Flood Risk Management Scheme.","details":{"body":"<p>On Wednesday 23 October 2019, 1pm till 5.30pm, the Environment Agency opens the doors to its visitor centre at Westmorland shopping centre for a fun filled afternoon planting tree seeds and decorating plant pots which people can then take home, nurture and plant.</p>\n\n<p>The event has kindly been supported by Homebase who are providing all the equipment, including the plant pots and compost the Tree Council, Kendal Conservation Volunteers and local artist, Lana Grindley, who will help people bring to life their decorative ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Lana Grindley of Love Arts Workshops, said: “I’m delighted to be able to support the Environment Agency in hosting this family activity day - it’s a great way children, families and local people to get creative whilst giving back to nature.</p>\n\n<p>“I really enjoy working alongside the local community and delivering creative workshops that get people’s creative juices flowing!</p>\n\n<p>“It’s free to attend and I’m really looking forward to helping people get involved and also help the Environment Agency in their mission to plant more trees in Kendal.”</p>\n\n<p>Stewart Mounsey, Environment Agency Flood Risk Manager for Cumbria, said: “We delighted to be able to host this half term event for youngsters, families and local people in Kendal and hope everyone has a fun day whilst helping our local environment.</p>\n\n<p>“The Tree Council have kindly provided guidance which people can take home to help people plant and care for their tree and we hope it helps children learn about the importance of caring for our natural environment.</p>\n\n<p>“We’d also love people’s thoughts and ideas to incorporate into our art strategy and work to improve public areas as part of the flood scheme.”</p>\n\n<p>The proposed Kendal Flood Risk Management Scheme will reduce the risk of flooding to 1,437 homes and 1,151 businesses across Kendal and surrounding areas to a 1% chance of flooding in any one year.</p>\n\n<p>As with every project they undertake, the Environment Agency also strive to improve our environment – and as well as delivering a flood risk management scheme, in Kendal, they will be restoring vital habitat, bringing nature back to certain areas, improving public spaces and access in the town, as well as looking at ways to incorporate community art into the scheme.</p>\n\n<p>The visitor centre is based in The Fell Tarn shop, 1st floor, Westmorland Shopping Centre, Kendal, where you can also find out the latest information about the Kendal Flood Risk Management Scheme:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Our plans and timescales</li>\n  <li>Scheme overview aesthetics and finishes (including samples of flood walls and glass panels)</li>\n  <li>Kendal public realm/art strategy (which is where we are planning on adding art into the scheme and improving public areas)</li>\n  <li>Environmental enhancements we are including as part of the project, mitigation throughout construction and tree planting</li>\n  <li>Property level flood resilience and resistance (individual property level protection)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here there is an opportunity for the public to feedback their thoughts and comments on the detailed designs to the project team and find out more about steps individuals can do to better protect their families and homes.</p>\n\n<p>As well as talking to the project team at the visitor’s centre, you can also email the project team with thoughts and ideas at <a href=\"mailto:KendalFRMS@environment-agency.gov.uk\">KendalFRMS@environment-agency.gov.uk</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Environment Agency is continuing with ground investigation, environmental studies and survey work for all three phases of the scheme, with main construction of the scheme starting in early 2020.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"european-regional-development-fund\">European Regional Development Fund</h2>\n\n<p>The project is receiving £5.34 million of funding from the England European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) as part of the European Structural and Investment Funds Growth Programme 2014-2020. The Department for Communities and Local Government is the Managing Authority for ERDF. Established by the European Union ERDF funds help local areas stimulate their economic development by investing in projects which will support innovation, businesses, create jobs and local community regenerations.
