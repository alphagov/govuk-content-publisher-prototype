available to help you benefit from a simplified approach to certificated family work with cost limits of £25,000.","details":{"body":"<p>Providers are reminded that we are now granting legal aid certificates with a wider limitation on costs for most family proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>We made this change in April 2019 and many of you are now benefiting from the new arrangements which are designed to free up administrative time.</p>\n\n<p>This is because of the reduced need for amendments to the cost limitation to be submitted once the certificate has been granted.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"why-is-this-reminder-needed\">Why is this reminder needed?</h3>\n\n<p>You need to make applications for a £25,000 cost limit within the Client and Cost Management System (CCMS).</p>\n\n<p>This is done by amending the default cost limit when you complete your application in the ‘proceedings and costs’ section of CCMS.</p>\n\n<p>This is not always happening in the way that it should. So, we would like to remind you that guidance is available to help you with the process in the ‘quick guides’ on the CCMS training website.</p>\n\n<p>The set number of proceedings this applies to are also outlined on the CCMS website.</p>\n\n<p>Following the process in the way intended means the correct cost limit will be applied to your application first time. So, it will not be held up by the need for us to contact you to check the work.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"further-information\">Further information</h3>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ccmstraining.justice.gov.uk/news-events-and-resources/news/changes-to-streamline-family-work\">CCMS website: changes to streamline family work</a> – family proceedings eligible for simplified application process</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ccmstraining.justice.gov.uk/Quick-guides/Quickguides/making-an-initial-application-1\">CCMS website: making an initial application</a> – download ‘£25000 cost limit’ quick guide</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/civil-news-changes-to-streamline-family-work-from-19-april-2019\">GOV.UK news story</a> – 18 April announcement of the new simplified process</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:Digital.Assist@justice.gov.uk\">Digital.Assist@justice.gov.uk</a> – to email enquiries about CCMS training</p>\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-07-08T13:46:12.536Z"}]},"document_status":"published_but_needs_2i","created_by":"Lucy Walker","last_updated_by":"Stefan Glowatz","political":false,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","start_date":"2015-05-07T23:00:00.000Z","end_date":"","current":true},"document_schema":"news"}
