proposed merger of 2 DNA sequencing system firms, Illumina and PacBio, raises competition concerns, an in-depth CMA review has provisionally found.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has issued its provisional findings as part of a Phase 2 merger investigation of the proposed $1.2 billion takeover by Illumina, Inc. (Illumina) of Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc (PacBio).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe companies are both global suppliers of Next-Generation DNA sequencing systems to organisations across the world, including UK universities, laboratories and research institutes. DNA sequencing systems are vital to the study of genetic variation in humans and other species, for purposes such as essential disease research and drug development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CMA’s provisional conclusion is that the merger will result in a significant loss of competition between the 2 companies, with few alternative providers of DNA sequencing systems remaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDNA sequencing is a highly concentrated industry and Illumina holds an approximately 80% share of the market globally and 90% in the UK. The CMA’s investigation has found that PacBio is one of Illumina’s closest competitors and vice versa.  The companies’ internal documents often refer to each other as competitive threats and this is consistent with the views of customers and the remaining competitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePacBio also recently released new, innovative technology and is well-positioned to be a stronger competitor in the future. The CMA is therefore concerned that the deal would remove a significant competitive threat to Illumina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDNA sequencing is a dynamic and rapidly developing sector where innovation is key.  The CMA considers that competition is one of the main factors that drives innovation and is concerned that the loss of PacBio as an independent competitor will lead to a reduction in overall levels of innovation in the market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStuart McIntosh, the Inquiry Chair, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eDNA sequencing is a highly concentrated industry and given the strength of Illumina in this market, and the limited number of alternative providers, the removal of an innovative competitor like PacBio is likely to have a significant impact on competition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThis could harm critically important innovation in the systems created to support DNA sequencing and lead to less choice, higher prices or lower quality as a result of the merger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information, visit the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/illumina-inc-pacific-biosciences-of-california-inc-merger-inquiry\"\u003ecase page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNotes to editors:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eNext-Generation Sequencing underlies the study of all organisms, and informs knowledge spanning basic biology to complex human diseases such as cancer. Next-Generation Sequencing is a dynamic industry, with new sequencing platforms and updates to technology being released frequently.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAll the CMA’s functions in phase 2 merger inquiries are performed by inquiry groups chosen from the CMA’s panel members. The appointed inquiry group are the decision-makers on phase 2 inquiries.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe CMA’s panel members come from a variety of backgrounds, including economics, law, accountancy and/or business; the membership of an inquiry group usually reflects a mix of expertise and experience.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe members of this inquiry group are Stuart McIntosh (Chair), Humphrey Battcock, Colleen Keck and John Thanassoulis.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_3c14b55f-b630-4089-85e9-62503358857c\" class=\"contact\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003eMedia enquiries\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"email\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eEmail\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003ca href=\"mailto:press@cma.gov.uk\" class=\"email\"\u003epress@cma.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003ePress office\u003c/span\u003e\n          020 3738 6460\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eOut-of-hours mobile (for urgent media requests only) \u003c/span\u003e\n          07774 134814\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003cp class=\"comments\"\u003eDuring working hours, please contact the main press office number.
