CMA has provisionally found that Fender Europe broke competition law by restricting online discounting for its guitars.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has today issued a Statement of Objections to Fender Musical Instruments Europe Limited, which supplies guitars to UK retailers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CMA has provisionally decided that between 2013 and 2018, Fender Europe operated a policy designed to restrict competitive online pricing, requiring guitars to be sold at or above a minimum figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe practice, known as resale price maintenance (RPM), is illegal. It restricts the possibility of discounting and, as a result, customers who shop around for a product are unlikely to find better deals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGuitars make up a significant part of the wider musical instrument sector which has an estimated turnover in the UK of around £440 million annually. Online sales of musical instruments have grown to around 40%, making it more important that people have access to competitive prices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnn Pope, CMA Senior Director of Antitrust, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eShopping online can make it much easier to compare prices and hunt down bargains - this can be especially important for potentially big purchases like a guitar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWe take allegations of RPM very seriously because it removes one of the benefits of the internet of making it easier to quickly find a better price by shopping around. It stops online retailers from selling at the prices they want to, and this then leads to higher prices for customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor businesses wanting to know more about RPM, the CMA has published \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/resale-price-maintenance-information-for-businesses\"\u003eguidance to help suppliers and retailers\u003c/a\u003e across all sectors, with information about what to do if they are, or may have been, involved in this or similar practices. Businesses can also watch the CMA’s short film that explains what RPM looks like in practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hObZs6m2jhw\"\u003eWhat is resale price maintenance (RPM)?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CMA’s findings are provisional, and no final decision has been made about whether there has been a breach of competition law.
