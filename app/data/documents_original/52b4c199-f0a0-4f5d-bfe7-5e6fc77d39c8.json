funding for councils to tackle criminal landlords\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThis new funding will ensure good landlords are supported to thrive, helping councils develop new ways to identify and stamp out poor landlords\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eBuilds on action taken last year which supported over a million tenants – this year doubling the funding to reach more people across the country\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils across the country will be able to access almost £4 million in new funding, as part of a crackdown on criminal landlords, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has announced today (4 November 2019).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis will support councils who can \u003ca

against landlords who break the law and provide inadequate service to their tenants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven though most landlords provide quality homes for their tenants, a small minority continue to break the law and offer inadequate or unsafe housing, leaving young families and vulnerable people feeling trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe funding will be used to allow good landlords to thrive, helping  millions of hard-working tenants renting privately get the homes they deserve, ensuring that those who follow the rules are not unfairly disadvantaged and creating a housing market that works for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the second year of this pioneering fund. Last year over £2 million of funding was shared amongst 56 projects – this reached 100 councils which together are home to over a million households living in the private rented sector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eIt’s unacceptable that a small minority of unscrupulous landlords appear to be breaking the law and providing homes which fall short of the standards that tenants rightly expect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eEveryone deserves to live in a home that is safe and secure, and the funding announced today will help to further strengthen councils’ powers to crack down on criminal landlords and drive up standards in the private rented sector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have given local authorities strong powers to force landlords to make necessary improvements to a property. They can use a range of measures, including fines and banning orders, to tackle criminal landlords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis funding helps councils to capitalise on their strengthened powers, last year being used to train hundreds of inspection officers and create new technologies to make sure inspectors spend their time taking action to improve the sector, not stuck behind a desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLast year the funding helped councils uncover hundreds of poor-quality homes and ensured that vulnerable tenants know they will be supported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, last year, Burnley received over £60,000 to carry out proactive inspections of rented homes in the area, allowing them to reach vulnerable tenants who are less likely to report a problem to their council. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe council found and fixed over 100 hazards across the properties they inspected. In some cases the funding helped tenants who were trapped in properties which posted a serious risk to their safety – meaning they could be rehoused in quality accommodation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe want to support a thriving private rented sector across the country. Through the funding announced today will want to encourage councils to share best practice of enforcement action and examples of inventive approaches that can be adopted in councils nationwide to drive quality and stamp out bad landlords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_c1f13fd8-9feb-4028-9323-7cb3383323b4\" class=\"contact\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003eMedia enquiries\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"email\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eEmail\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003ca href=\"mailto:newsdesk@communities.gov.uk\" class=\"email\"\u003enewsdesk@communities.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003ePlease use this number if you are a journalist wishing to speak to Press Office\u003c/span\u003e\n          0303 444 1209\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_bfc00333-a9ee-4ca1-9d3c-432dbcdf4640\" class=\"contact postal-address\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003eOffice address and general enquiries\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n      \u003cp class=\"adr\"\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"street-address\"\u003e2 Marsham Street\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLondon\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"postal-code\"\u003eSW1P 4DF\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"contact_form_url\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eContact form\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003ca href=\"https://forms.communities.gov.uk/\"\u003ehttps://forms.communit...\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eGeneral enquiries:  please use this number if you are a member of the public\u003c/span\u003e\n          030 3444 0000\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_f375ee5c-c7f3-4e09-9ba8-2ca0308481c5\" class=\"contact\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003eSocial media - MHCLG\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n      \u003cp class=\"comments\"\u003eTwitter - \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mhclg\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/mhclg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFlickr - \u003ca href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mhclg\"\u003ehttp://www.flickr.com/photos/mhclg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLinkedIn - \u003ca href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/company/mhclg\"\u003ehttp://www.linkedin.com/company/mhclg\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dbffe0c40f0b6379ee2b4f9/housing-trees-960x640.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dbffe0be5274a4aa29e3c9b/housing-trees-960x640.jpg","alt_text":"picture of housing","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-11-04T11:18:36.326Z"}]}}
