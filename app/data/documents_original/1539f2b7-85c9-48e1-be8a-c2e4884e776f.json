CMA has raised concerns that passengers could face higher fares on two routes in the Norwich–Ely area under the new East Midlands Rail franchise.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is responsible for looking into the awarding of rail franchises as part of its mergers work, and has therefore been investigating the award of the East Midlands Rail Franchise to Abellio. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Phase 1 probe has found competition concerns on 2  of the routes Abellio would operate – Norwich to Ely and Thetford to Ely. This is because  under current proposals for the franchise, Abellio would operate both East Midlands Trains and Greater Anglia, and so provide the only train services on this line. The CMA is concerned that this could reduce competition, as passengers have no other rail options, which could lead to higher fares. The CMA has found no concerns on the other routes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJoel Bamford, Senior Director of Mergers at the CMA, said: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eThousands of people rely on this route, so it’s crucial that passengers don’t suffer as a result of reduced competition. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eIf the franchise is awarded to Abellio as currently planned, we’re concerned passengers could face increased prices. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWe look forward to hearing from Abellio about how they will seek to overcome these concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAbellio has offered to work with the CMA to keep fares and advance ticket availability at current levels on the 2 routes. In previous similar cases, such as the award of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/arriva-rail-north-northern-rail-franchise-merger-inquiry\"\u003eNorthern franchise to Arriva\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/firstgroup-and-mtr-south-western-rail-franchise-merger-inquiry\"\u003eFirstGroup and MTR’s acquisition of South Western\u003c/a\u003e, the CMA’s concerns were resolved by the operator agreeing to price-caps on the affected lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CMA’s decision comes in advance of the start of the franchise, due to begin on 18 August. Further details can be found on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/abellio-east-midlands-limited-east-midlands-rail-franchise\"\u003ecase page\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNotes for editors\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe CMA is the UK’s primary competition and consumer authority.

If it does not propose UILs, or if the CMA is not satisfied with them, the merger will be referred to an in-depth (‘phase 2’) investigation.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe CMA will announce by 2 August 2019 its preliminary decision on whether any UILs offered by Abellio might be sufficient to resolve the competition concerns identified. If the CMA provisionally accepts UILs, a consultation will follow.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMedia enquiries to the CMA should be directed to \u003ca href=\"mailto:press@cma.gov.uk\"\u003epress@cma.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e or 020 3738 6460.\u003c/p\u003e\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d304ef5ed915d2feaf5f86d/emtcrop.png","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d304ef240f0b64a7fa8b3a9/emtcrop.png","alt_text":"An East Mindlands Train traveling past greenery","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-07-19T08:57:49.364Z"}]}}
