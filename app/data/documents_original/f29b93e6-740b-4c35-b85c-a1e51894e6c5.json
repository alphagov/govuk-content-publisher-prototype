convicted of stalking, harassment, child sexual abuse and other sex offences could see their sentences increased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe scheme gives victims or members of the public the power to ask the Attorney General to consider whether a sentence could be reconsidered by the Court of Appeal, where it could it then be increased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCrimes such as murder, robbery, and a range of terror offences are already covered, and now the government is introducing legislation to extend the scheme further to protect the public and make sure victims see justice done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe extension follows wider action to restore faith in the criminal justice system – with the recruitment of 20,000 police officers, investing £2.75 billion in prisons, £85 million for the Crown Prosecution Service and reviewing sentencing to ensure violent and sexual offenders spend longer behind bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSecretary of State for

taking greater steps to tackle violent crime in our communities.
