are using slow and unreliable internet supplied through copper lines, which restricts the ability to offer digital services to patients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday’s announcement supports ambitions in the NHS Long Term Plan to expand and improve online access to NHS services. Under the plan:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eevery patient will get the right to choose a ‘digital first’ approach to primary healthcare, meaning that more of the 307 million patient consultations with GPs each year would in future be offered online, through video consultation, as well as face to face\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehospital outpatient clinics will also be redesigned with more ‘virtual clinics’ involving video consultations with consultants and nurses, supplemented by face-to-face appointments where necessary\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecloud-based patient records will help clinicians access crucial information, including high-resolution images, anywhere in the country, improving patient safety and speeding up appointments\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUpgrading broadband will provide the fast, more reliable connections necessary for video consultations and sharing high-definition images at speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Every day, our NHS staff do amazing work – but too often they are let down by outdated and unreliable technology.
