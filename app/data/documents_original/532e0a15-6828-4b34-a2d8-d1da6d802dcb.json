government-funded scheme provides GPs and others providing NHS services for general practice with comprehensive, automatic cover for clinical negligence claims.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eGPs will benefit from comprehensive indemnity cover for future NHS clinical negligence claims under a new government-backed scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://resolution.nhs.uk/services/claims-management/clinical-claims/clinical-negligence-scheme-for-general-practice/\"\u003eClinical Negligence Scheme for General Practice\u003c/a\u003e is designed to provide more stable and affordable indemnity cover for GPs. Cover will be provided automatically and at no charge to GPs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe scheme will provide cover for all GPs and their practice teams for clinical negligence incidents, relating to provision of NHS primary medical services, occuring from 1 April 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe scheme will be administered by \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://resolution.nhs.uk/\"\u003eNHS Resolution\u003c/a\u003e on behalf of the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. It will allow the government to have greater oversight of costs and claims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Department of Health and Social Care (\u003cabbr title=\"Department of Health and Social Care\"\u003eDHSC\u003c/abbr\u003e) has also committed to put an existing liabilities scheme (ELS) in place subject to reaching agreement with the medical defence organisations. This would cover claims for historical NHS clinical negligence liabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of this commitment, \u003cabbr title=\"Department of Health and Social Care\"\u003eDHSC\u003c/abbr\u003e has agreed commercial terms with the Medical Protection Society (MPS) covering NHS clinical negligence claims made against their GP members in respect of liabilities arising before 1 April 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNHS Resolution will have oversight of the arrangements for the new scheme and, for an interim period, claims handling will be retained by the MPS. Discussions are ongoing with other medical defence organisations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe introduction of the scheme delivers an important part of the GP contract for 2019 to 2020. The extra support for GPs follows commitments which made primary care central to the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/\"\u003eNHS Long Term Plan\u003c/a\u003e. It will help improve the recruitment and retention of GPs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Long Term Plan aims to bring up to 20,000 extra staff into general practice by 2023 to 2024, including pharmacists and social prescribing link workers. This would free up GPs to spend more time with patients who need them most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMinister of State for Care, Caroline Dinenage, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eGPs are the bedrock of the NHS and they are at the heart of delivering the Long Term Plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThe launch of a new government-backed scheme as part of a landmark new contract demonstrates our clear commitment to supporting a sustainable future for general practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThis new scheme will bring significant benefits to general practice staff, bringing arrangements in line with those for NHS trusts so GPs and their staff can focus on continuing to provide excellent care to patients, knowing they have comprehensive cover in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c9e0694ed915d07af076ef0/close-up-of-doctor-making-notes.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c9e069640f0b633f83274ee/close-up-of-doctor-making-notes.jpg","alt_text":"GP doing paperwork at desk","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-04-01T13:32:27.068Z"}]}}
