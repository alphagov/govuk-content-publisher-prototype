investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into drug firms King Pharmaceuticals Limited, Alissa Healthcare Research Limited and Lexon (UK) Limited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn June 2019, the CMA issued a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/suppliers-of-antidepressants-accused-of-illegal-anti-competitive-conduct\"\u003estatement of objections\u003c/a\u003e

up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNortriptyline is prescribed by the NHS and relied on by thousands of patients every month to relieve the symptoms of depression. NHS spending on the drug peaked at £38 million in 2015.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eKing and Alissa have now admitted breaking competition law by exchanging strategic and competitively-sensitive information with one another and with Lexon during periods between 2015 and 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CMA’s investigation into Lexon is ongoing as the firm denies involvement in the suspected infringement.
