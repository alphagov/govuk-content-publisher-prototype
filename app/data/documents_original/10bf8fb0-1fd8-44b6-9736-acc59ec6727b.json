would ensure more sprinklers in new high-rise blocks of flats.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThousands of residents will benefit from safer homes under proposals that would see sprinklers installed in new high-rise blocks of flats, the government announced today (5 September 2019).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe proposals are an important step forward in the government’s commitment to ensuring residents are safe in their homes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government is consulting on reducing the building height for when sprinklers are required from the current 30 metres (approximately 10 floors) and above to 18 metres (approximately 6 floors) or other relevant thresholds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a new Protection Board is being set-up immediately with the Home Office and National Fire Chiefs Council to provide further reassurance to residents of high-risk residential blocks that any risks are identified and acted upon. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Communities Secretary has made up to £10 million a year of funding available to support the Board who will provide expert, tailored building checks and inspections, if necessary, on all high-risk residential buildings in England by 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Board will operate until a new building safety regulator is established to oversee the new regulatory regime for buildings and legislation on a new building safety regime is introduced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTheir work will ensure building owners are acting on the latest safety advice and keeping residents updated and that interim measures are in place in all buildings with unsafe aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis work will be informed by current data collection work of local authorities to identify types of cladding on high-rise residential buildings, for which government is providing an additional £4 million funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs of 12 September, the government is opening the application process for the £200 million fund to accelerate the pace of the removal and replacement of unsafe ACM from privately-owned buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Secretary of State for Housing, Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eResidents’ safety is our utmost priority and we are making vital improvements to ensure buildings are safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eI have listened to concerns on sprinklers from residents and building owners and our proposals are an important step forward in shaping the future building safety standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThe new Protection Board will make sure building owners don’t flout the rules, as well as ensuring fire safety risks in other buildings are being addressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking on the £200 million of funding for private building owners to remove unsafe cladding the Secretary of State said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eGovernment funds are available for private building owners to remove and replace unsafe ACM cladding, and let me be clear, inaction will have consequences and I will name and shame those who do not act during the course of the autumn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThere is no excuse for further delay – and for building owners to fail to take action now would be frankly disgraceful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 12-week fire safety consultation on sprinklers and other measures forms part of the first proposed changes to building regulations in England covering fire safety within and around buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt also seeks views to introduce an emergency evacuation alert system for use by fire and rescue services, alongside other fire safety measures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding Safety Minister Lord Younger said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eI’m determined to ensure buildings across the country are safe for residents and the opening of our private sector fund and commitment to new building safety legislation is an important step in driving that forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThis government is acting and I’m calling on all building owners and developers to step up and make any changes needed to ensure their buildings are safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"approved-document-b-consultation\"\u003eApproved Document B consultation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn December 2018, the government issued a call for evidence on the technical review of Approved Document B of the building regulations.
