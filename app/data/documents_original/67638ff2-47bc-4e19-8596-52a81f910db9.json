CMA has provisionally found that Casio has broken competition law by restricting retailer freedom to discount online.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has

Ltd (Casio) which, as part of its business, supplies digital pianos and keyboards to UK retailers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CMA has provisionally decided that Casio implemented a policy designed to restrict retailers’ freedom to set their own prices online between 2013 and 2018, requiring them to sell at – or above – a minimum price, and so preventing them from offering price discounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis kind of illegal practice, known as resale price maintenance (RPM), means customers miss out on the best possible prices. Customers lose out on cheaper prices online because, even when they shop around, they find all retailers tend to be selling at around the same price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn recent years, software has also made it easier for both suppliers and retailers to monitor online prices. As a result, suppliers can find out more quickly about lower online prices and can pressurise retailers to stick with the agreed price. The use of this ‘all-seeing’ software is also likely to reduce further the incentives for retailers to reduce their prices in the first place for fear of being caught and being sanctioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CMA’s findings are provisional and no final decision has been made about whether there has been a breach of competition law. \nWe will now carefully consider representations from the company before reaching a final decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnn Pope, CMA Senior Director of Antitrust, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eCompanies that sell online can bring many benefits to people who are looking for more choice, convenience and lower prices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThat’s why it’s important that online retailers are free to sell at the prices they see fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWe take allegations of online resale price maintenance seriously because it can lead to higher prices and limit choice for customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDigital pianos and keyboards are a significant part of the wider UK musical instruments sector which is estimated at around £440 million annually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor businesses wanting to know more about RPM, the CMA has published \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/resale-price-maintenance-information-for-businesses\"\u003eguidance to help suppliers and retailers\u003c/a\u003e across all sectors, with information about what to do if they are, or may have been, involved in RPM or similar practices.
