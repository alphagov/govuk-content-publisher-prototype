Environment Agency is urging communities in England to remain vigilant against the threat of flooding with 107 Flood Warnings – meaning flooding is expected – and 149 Flood Alerts – meaning flooding is possible - (as at 14.00) in place across the country.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eFlooding is expected to cause continued disruption to communities in South Yorkshire, and parts of Lincolnshire and the north Midlands into next week. Areas of Gloucestershire around the River Severn, and near the River Avon in Worcestershire and Warwickshire are expected to be affected by flooding today until Monday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMore localised flooding is also possible in the east and north-east of England on Sunday, due to the potential for further rain or showers falling on wet ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnvironment Agency teams have been working around the clock to protect communities from flooding. Incident rooms will remain open across the weekend to monitor the unsettled weather forecast due over the weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver 21,000 properties have been protected by flood defences in England, since the flooding began, including nearly 7,000 properties in Yorkshire alone.

We currently have 55 high volume pumps, including two ultra-high volume units,  extracting 22 cubic metres of water per second help protect homes and business in South Yorkshire. If pumping in Fishlake continues at the current rate, the community will be free of floodwater by Sunday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eKate Marks, Flood Duty Manager at the Environment Agency, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Communities in northern England, northern and western parts of the Midlands should remain vigilant to the risk of flooding with further rainfall expected over the weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Over 20,000 properties have been protected from flooding thanks to Environment Agency flood schemes.
