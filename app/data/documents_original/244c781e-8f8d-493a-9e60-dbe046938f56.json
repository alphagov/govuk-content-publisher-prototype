Once inside, they will need to characterise the challenge, including measuring and visualising the radioactivity, before cutting up the contents (including large vessels and many miles of pipework), segregating waste, then removing it for treatment and safe storage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the key challenges has been to develop a smooth interaction between all the different component parts to achieve an integrated approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNDA Technology and Innovation Director Melanie Brownridge said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWhilst this competition focusses on deployment at Sellafield, we’re really keen that other potential end-users can come and see the progress and understand how it could help them too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll projects are led by private-sector consortia and include large corporations, academic institutions and small businesses, some of which are new to the nuclear sector.
