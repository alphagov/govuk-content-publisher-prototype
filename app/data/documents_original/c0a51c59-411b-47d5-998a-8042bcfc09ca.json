numbers of vulnerable people sleeping rough on the country’s streets. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rough Sleeping Initiative – a cornerstone of the government’s ambitious Rough Sleeping Strategy – has provided £76 million to 246 councils across the country to date, supporting rough sleepers in their area off the streets and into secure accommodation where they can get the help they need to rebuild their lives. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe report published today (12 September 2019) shows that the Rough Sleeping Initiative has reduced the number of vulnerable people sleeping rough by 32%, compared to the number it would have been had the initiative not been in place.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe analysis estimates the impact of the initiative from its launch in March 2018 until autumn that year and takes account of a range of factors, including whether councils submitted estimates or counts in the official annual rough sleeping statistics, the weather on the night the data was collected, and local housing and labour market conditions, to zero in on the effects of the initiative. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWelcoming the evaluation findings, Communities Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eSince becoming Communities Secretary in July, I have been able to see first-hand the outstanding work taking place under the Rough Sleeping Initiative every single day to transform the lives of society’s most vulnerable – and these figures are proof that our strategy to end rough sleeping is working. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eBut we must keep that momentum up, which is why we have committed a record investment to tackling homelessness and rough sleeping in the months ahead – ensuring progress continues to be made and people are given the help they need to turn their lives around. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday’s figures come just days after the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced £422 million of funding to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping – up £54 million from £368 million in 2019 to 2020. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Communities Secretary and the Chancellor have also announced a further £10 million to boost life-saving support for rough sleepers during the cold winter weather and has called on councils to come forward and bid for the funding now in order to step-up preparations in time for the winter months.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLast year, funding provided by government during the coldest weather meant thousands of vulnerable rough sleepers spent the night in safe and warm accommodation, rather than on the streets. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn August last year, the government unveiled its \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-rough-sleeping-strategy\"\u003eRough Sleeping Strategy\u003c/a\u003e – backed by £100 million – which sets out the next steps towards ending rough sleeping for good.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis forms part of a wider strategy to tackle all forms of homelessness, including: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003einvesting £1.2 billon to tackle homelessness\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eproviding £76 million for the Rough

whether councils submitted estimates or counts in the official annual rough sleeping statistics, the weather on the night the data was collected and local housing and labour market conditions, to assess the effects of the programme and ensure the results were unbiased and not the result of other external factors.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnalysis also shows \u003cabbr title=\"Rough

rough sleeping based on the 2017 annual rough sleeping statistics. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019 to 2020, the government allocated a further £46 million – including £12 million for councils not previously funded – to build on the programme’s work and help even more people off the streets and to move forward with their lives. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnalysis was independently peer reviewed by Bryson Purdon Social Research, an independent research partnership.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to reach as many rough sleepers as possible, £1 million of the Cold Weather Fund will be available to providers and services that are not commissioned by local authorities. This element of the fund will be administered by Homeless Link, who will ensure interventions are effective in supporting as many people as possible off the streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_bfc00333-a9ee-4ca1-9d3c-432dbcdf4640\" class=\"contact postal-address\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003eOffice address and general enquiries\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n      \u003cp class=\"adr\"\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"street-address\"\u003e2 Marsham Street\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLondon\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"postal-code\"\u003eSW1P 4DF\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"contact_form_url\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eContact form\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003ca href=\"https://forms.communities.gov.uk/\"\u003ehttps://forms.communit...\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eGeneral enquiries:  please use this number if you are a member of the public\u003c/span\u003e\n          030 3444 0000\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_c1f13fd8-9feb-4028-9323-7cb3383323b4\" class=\"contact\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003eMedia enquiries\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"email\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eEmail\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003ca href=\"mailto:newsdesk@communities.gov.uk\" class=\"email\"\u003enewsdesk@communities.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003ePlease use this number if you are a journalist wishing to speak to Press Office\u003c/span\u003e\n          0303 444 1209\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_f375ee5c-c7f3-4e09-9ba8-2ca0308481c5\" class=\"contact\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003eSocial media - MHCLG\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n      \u003cp class=\"comments\"\u003eTwitter - \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mhclg\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/mhclg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFlickr - \u003ca href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mhclg\"\u003ehttp://www.flickr.com/photos/mhclg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLinkedIn - \u003ca href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/company/mhclg\"\u003ehttp://www.linkedin.com/company/mhclg\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d7a0988e5274a20376e18e8/homelessness-960-x-640.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d7a098740f0b61c992ba456/homelessness-960-x-640.jpg","alt_text":"young person","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-09-12T12:47:05.018Z"}]}}
