PC World has agreed to change how it sells extended warranties after its staff gave mystery shoppers incorrect information.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eExtended warranties offer people the chance to pay for increased protection when buying products, over and above the standard guarantee. Under a legal Order issued by the Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) predecessor, the Competition Commission, all electrical retailers selling extended warranties are required to provide accurate information to their customers so they can make informed decisions about whether the extra cover is worth buying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of this, Currys arranged for mystery shops to take place at 100 of its stores. The mystery shoppers found around a quarter of staff tested could not provide accurate information on whether cosmetic damage was covered. For example, they were told products would be replaced if they were damaged but still worked, when this was not the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CMA has since been working with Currys to improve the way it sells this type of warranty. The retailer is now making several changes, including introducing extra training for staff; and posters and leaflets around its shops will be clearer in explaining what is and isn’t covered. Currys will also implement a new monthly mystery shopping programme to make sure its staff abide by the rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs well as ensuring retailers sell extended warranties fairly, the CMA has today published a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/extended-warranties-what-you-need-to-know-before-you-buy\"\u003enew guide\u003c/a\u003e on what people should consider before taking out an extended warranty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt includes advice such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eextended warranties are optional - you don’t have to buy one\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou might be covered already, so check other insurance products such as home contents\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethink about whether you really need protection.
