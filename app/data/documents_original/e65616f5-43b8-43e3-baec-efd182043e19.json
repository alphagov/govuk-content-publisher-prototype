Agency teams are relocating hundreds of native crayfish to help boost their numbers.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eHundreds of native crayfish have been carefully hand-collected and moved to a remote refuge as part of a project to grow their numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnvironment Agency ecologists have relocated the white-clawed crayfish – a protected species under threat across the country – to sites where their populations can flourish out of harm’s way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new sites are free of the larger, more aggressive, invasive signal crayfish – which outcompete the native species for food and habitat and carry a disease fatal to the UK species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a day-long operation, a dozen officers collected around 350 native crayfish from a stretch of the River Witham near Grantham, checked their size, health and gender, and moved them to a secret site on a Lincolnshire lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRegular monitoring will keep tabs on their numbers as the crayfish distribute across their new home and start to breed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe work is part of a national scheme known as the ‘Ark project’, aiming to secure the future of white-clawed crayfish in England. The species has been in decline since non-native American signal crayfish escaped into UK waters in the 1970s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis relocation is the second such rescue in the county after a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/native-crayfish-make-a-comeback-in-lincolnshire\"\u003esimilar effort in 2017\u003c/a\u003e saw hundreds of crayfish successfully transferred to chalk streams in the Lincolnshire Wolds. Surveys carried out in the area since have confirmed the crayfish are breeding and boosting the population.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image embedded\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d70d2d8e5274a097d6dd919/crayfish-checking-web.jpg\" alt=\"Two Environment Agency officers in a river collecting crayfish\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe crayfish will be examined by EA officers before being moved to their new location\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRichard Chadd, senior environmental monitoring officer with the Environment Agency, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eLincolnshire’s flat, open rivers and pristine chalk streams are a haven for native crayfish, making our county one of the largest strongholds in England for this protected species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThey’re a vital part of the local ecology, which is why we’re working so hard to protect them – and these efforts are just part of our ongoing work to improve the environment for people and nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhite-clawed crayfish, named for the pale colour of the underside of their claws, are the country’s largest native freshwater crustaceans.
