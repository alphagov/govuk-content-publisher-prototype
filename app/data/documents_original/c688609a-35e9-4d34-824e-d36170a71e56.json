experiences motivate me to make life fairer for terminally ill people, Amber Rudd said today (11 July 2019).","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eCiting her own personal experiences, Amber Rudd has asked the Department for Work and Pensions (\u003cabbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\"\u003eDWP\u003c/abbr\u003e) to set up an honest and in depth evaluation of how the benefits system supports people nearing the end of their life and those with severe conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Special Rules for Terminal Illness mean that if you are living with a terminal illness you can have your benefit claim fast tracked and paid at enhanced rates many charities have campaigned for the rules to be changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWork and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eHaving a life limiting illness or severe condition can cause unimaginable suffering for the patient and for their loved ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eHaving seen it in my own family I know that the last thing you need is additional financial pressures or unnecessary assessments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eSo that’s why today I am beginning work on a fresh and honest evaluation of our benefits system so that I can be sure that people who are nearing the end of their life are getting the best possible support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003e I hope that this comprehensive evaluation of how we treat those with severe conditions and terminal illnesses will help ensure these vulnerable people get the support they need from our benefits system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eI want people to have confidence in what we do at the \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\"\u003eDWP\u003c/abbr\u003e, ensuring no one is suffering unnecessary hardship at this especially difficult time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNot all doctors understand the system or feel confident they are making the right diagnosis for their patients, and the rules are often seen as favouring those living with cancer when other heart breaking illnesses can also limit life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor those living with the most severe or progressive conditions, benefit processes have recently been made simpler, moving them out of unnecessary reassessments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the Work and Pensions Secretary wants to look again to make sure that these processes are working effectively and to see if more can be done to improve engagement with the department for claimants living with the most severe conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAmber Rudd yesterday visited the Macmillan Horizon Centre cancer support in Brighton to begin conversations with stakeholders and today will host a number of charities at the \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\"\u003eDWP\u003c/abbr\u003e, including Macmillan and Hospice UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eShe has also ordered the department to seek the views of a wide range of people, including patients, doctors and nurses. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe review will include 3 strands of research:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehearing directly from claimants and charities about their first-hand experiences\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003econsidering international evidence to find out what works in other nations and the support they provide\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ereviewing current \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\"\u003eDWP\u003c/abbr\u003e performance to better understand how our Special Rules for Terminal Illness and Severe Conditions processes operate and perform\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAmber Rudd will also seek senior medical input to help shape the evaluation and review the evidence gathered. Professor Bee Wee, NHS National Clinical Director for End of Life Care for NHS England is attending today’s roundtable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAround 500,000 people die in England each year and around three-quarters of those deaths are expected – that is they are not sudden or unexpected. There are many more people who are living with severe or progressive health conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"contact-press-office\"\u003eContact Press Office\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMedia enquiries for this press release - 020 3267 5126\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003ePress Office\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n      \u003cp class=\"adr\"\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"street-address\"\u003eCaxton House\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTothill Street\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"locality\"\u003eLondon\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"postal-code\"\u003eSW1H 9NA\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eLondon Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims)\u003c/span\u003e\n          020 3267 5144\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eOut-of-hours (journalists only)\u003c/span\u003e\n          07623 928 975\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eEngland and Wales (local media enquiries)\u003c/span\u003e\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eScotland (local media enquiries)\u003c/span\u003e\n          0131 310 1122\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollow \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\"\u003eDWP\u003c/abbr\u003e on:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\"\u003eLinkedIn\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-07-10T10:50:07.564Z"}]}}
