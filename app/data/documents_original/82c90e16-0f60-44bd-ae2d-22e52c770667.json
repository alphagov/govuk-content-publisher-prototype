people will be able to see how every pound of property developers’ cash, levied on new buildings, is spent supporting the new homes their community needs.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eLocal people will be able to see how every pound of property developers’ cash, levied on new buildings, is spent supporting the new homes their community needs, thanks to new rules coming into force today (1 September 2019).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBuilders already have to pay up for roads, schools, GP surgeries and parkland needed when local communities expand – in 2016 to 2017 alone they paid a whopping £6 billion towards local infrastructure helping create jobs and growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYet before today, councils were not required to report on the total amount of funding received – or how it was spent – leaving local residents in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNew rules will mean councils will be legally required to publish vital deals done with housing developers so residents can see exactly how money will be spent investing in the future of their community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHousing Minister Rt Hon Esther McVey MP said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThe new rules coming into force today will allow residents to know how developers are contributing to the local community when they build new homes - whether that’s contributing to building a brand-new school, roads or a doctor’s surgery that the area needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe reformed Community Infrastructure Levy (\u003cabbr title=\"Community Infrastructure Levy\"\u003eCIL\u003c/abbr\u003e) rules will help developers get shovels in the ground more quickly, and help the government meet its ambition to deliver 300,000 extra homes a year by the mid-2020s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe rules are designed to support councils and give greater confidence to communities about the benefits new housing can bring to their area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"further-information\"\u003eFurther information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNew \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/community-infrastructure-levy\"\u003eplanning practice guidance\u003c/a\u003e has also been published today, which seeks to further simplify advice on the \u003cabbr title=\"Community Infrastructure Levy\"\u003eCIL\u003c/abbr\u003e regime, helping communities and developers understand what is required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils will be required to publish an annual report on the all the \u003cabbr title=\"Community Infrastructure Levy\"\u003eCIL\u003c/abbr\u003e agreements entered into with developers from December 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe regulations make it faster for councils to introduce the \u003cabbr title=\"Community Infrastructure Levy\"\u003eCIL\u003c/abbr\u003e in the first place – so areas can benefit from getting the infrastructure they need in good time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRestrictions will also be eased to allow councils to fund single, larger infrastructure projects from the cash received from multiple developments, giving greater freedom to deliver complex projects at pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv
