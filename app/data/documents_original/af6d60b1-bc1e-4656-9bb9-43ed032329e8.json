requirement upon every council in England from next year, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs outlined in the Queen’s Speech, the government intends to amend the landmark Domestic Abuse Bill to include for the first time a statutory duty on councils to provide support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bill will transform the response to domestic abuse to better protect victims and their children, ensure they have the support they need, as well as pursuing their abusers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany councils are already providing tailored support to those in need, but this move will bring an end to the postcode lottery of support for those fleeing abusive relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis step forms part of a wider government drive to bolster protection for survivors of domestic abuse including the landmark Domestic Abuse Bill which is currently before the House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal Government Secretary, Robert Jenrick MP, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eDomestic abuse destroys lives and leaves victims living in fear in the place where they should feel most safe – their homes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThis duty upon councils will now be brought forward – ensuring survivors get the help they need wherever they are, so they can rebuild their lives away from the threat of abuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThis government is determined to pursue abusers, better protect victims and their children, and ensure they have the support they need – so we can end this abhorrent practice for good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAhead of this new duty coming into force in 2021, the government has also announced a further £15 million in funding to run these essential services in 2020 to 2021 – a 20% increase on 2019 to 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe duty will then be funded from April 2021, subject to future spending review discussions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, the Domestic Abuse Bill will bring about the first ever statutory government definition of domestic abuse to specifically include economic abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical abuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bill will also establish a new Domestic Abuse Commissioner and prohibit the cross-examination of victims by their abusers in the family courts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal authorities will also be required to develop and publish strategies which set out in detail the range of support services available for those fleeing violent relationships – including refuge accommodation and specialist support from safety through to independence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSandra Horley CBE, Chief Executive of national domestic abuse charity Refuge, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eThis much needed change in the law could mean an end to the postcode lottery of finding emergency accommodation, and would ensure critical specialist services are on a much more sustainable financial footing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWe look forward to working with the government to make sure every woman and child can access the support they need, and that means sustainable funding that meets need and addresses current shortfalls.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn November last year, ministers awarded a further £22 million for domestic abuse projects across England – ensuring thousands more survivors have access to the help they need as they move towards a safe and healthy future, free from domestic abuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFunding is helping to provide over 2,200 new beds in refuges and other safe accommodation, as well as access to education and tailored employment and life skills guidance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this action will help more people understand domestic abuse better and ensure those that need it can access the support they need, while staying safe and protected from future abuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"further-information\"\u003eFurther information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe launch of this \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/support-for-victims-of-domestic-abuse-in-safe-accommodation\"\u003econsultation\u003c/a\u003e received widespread support, including from Women’s Aid, which said “We warmly welcome this announcement, which shows the government’s commitment to the long-term funding of lifesaving refuges.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn November 2018, the government confirmed that \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/22-million-for-projects-to-support-domestic-abuse-survivors\"\u003e63 projects across England were to share £22 million\u003c/a\u003e to help domestic abuse survivors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat funding has helped to provide tailored support to more than 25,000 survivors and their families – including over 2,200 additional beds in refuges and other safe accommodation\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Domestic Abuse Bill had its second reading on Wednesday 2 October.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bill includes measures such as introducing a statutory definition of domestic abuse, Domestic Abuse Protection Orders and banning the cross-examination of victims by their perpetrators in family proceedings. We have already appointed a Designate Domestic Abuse Commissioner, who will promote best practice and highlight the plight of some of the most vulnerable victims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStatutory guidance also now strongly encourages councils to prioritise domestic abuse survivors who are ready to move on from refuges when allocating social housing, to free up valuable refuge spaces for others who may need them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government published its \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/support-for-victims-of-domestic-abuse-in-safe-accommodation\"\u003eresponse to the consultation\u003c/a\u003e on 14 October.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new £15 million fund will ensure vital safe accommodation services including refuges are maintained ahead of the new duty coming into force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis builds on other actions being taken by the government to end domestic abuse and tackle violence against women against girls, supporting survivors and ensuring offenders are prosecuted.
