Health England (\u003cabbr title=\"Public Health England\"\u003ePHE\u003c/abbr\u003e), in partnership with the NHS, today (Monday 7 October 2019) launches \u003ca rel=\"external\"

support others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is increasingly recognised that taking care of our mental health is as important as maintaining good physical health. A new \u003cabbr title=\"Public Health England\"\u003ePHE\u003c/abbr\u003e survey reveals more than 8 in ten (83%) people have experienced early signs of poor mental health including feeling anxious, stressed, having low mood or trouble sleeping in the last 12 months\u003csup id=\"fnref:1\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\"\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e. While these can be a natural response to life’s challenges, they can become more serious if people don’t take action, and many wait too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver a quarter (27%) of people who experienced signs of poor mental health waited at least 6 months before taking action to manage their mental health, with three quarters (74%) of those who waited this long wishing they had done so sooner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEvery Mind Matters shows people the simple steps they can take to be better prepared for life’s ups and downs. The new platform, which has been endorsed by the Royal College of General Practitioners (\u003cabbr title=\"Royal College of General Practitioners\"\u003eRGCP\u003c/abbr\u003e), will enable people to create a personalised action plan recommending a set of self-care actions to deal with stress, boost mood, improve sleep and feel in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA special film to promote Every Mind Matters has been written by Richard Curtis and directed by Rankin, narrated by Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and The Duke and Duchess of Sussex. It shows how we can all look after our mental health and will be aired at around 8:45pm on Monday night (7 October 2019) across ITV, Channel 4 and Sky channels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe powerful film features a range of people whose lives have been affected by poor mental health, including a cast of well-known faces: Gillian Anderson, Glenn Close, Freddie Flintoff, Professor Green, Davina McCall, Jordan Stephens, Will Young, Sir Bradley Wiggins, Nadiya Hussain, Sarah Taylor, Rob Beckett, Katie Piper, Joe Sugg and Alastair Campbell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe launch follows 18 months of planning and local and regional piloting, developed with clinical and academic experts, national mental health charities and input from people with experience of poor mental health. Clinically-assured by the NHS, Every Mind Matters is evidence-based and it shows people how to build simple changes into their daily lives – such as reframing unhelpful thoughts, breathing exercises and increasing physical activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll of these have well evidenced impact on improving and maintaining good mental health, which can help people to get more out of life, feel and function better, have more positive relationships and  manage difficult times – now and in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEvery Mind Matters is backed by a coalition of mental health charities and champions, including Mind, Mental Health Foundation, \u003cabbr title=\"Mental Health First Aid\"\u003eMHFA\u003c/abbr\u003e England, Samaritans, Heads Together, Centre for Mental Health, Rethink, Time to Change, NSUN, What Works Centre for Wellbeing and Good Thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis new resource is available for the public and for \u003cabbr title=\"general practitioners (family doctors)\"\u003eGPs\u003c/abbr\u003e to advise their patients to use.  The NHS will also promote Every Mind Matters to its one-million plus workforce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the nation’s biggest companies from the high street, entertainment, sport and finance have pledged to adopt Every Mind Matters for their employees, customers and fans. These include Greggs and the England and Wales Cricket Board, who will be empowering their staff and the public to take their mental health into their own hands and encouraging them to create their own action plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eOur health - both mental and physical - is an asset that needs to be nurtured.

It will offer vital support to those living with a mental health condition and give each of us valuable and personalised tips on how to better cope with life’s daily struggles, while contributing to tackling the stigma that can still surround mental health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eOur health is affected by our circumstances, including having a job, friends and a roof over our heads.

So at the same time the NHS is expanding the availability of specialist mental health support and treatment, people are increasingly interested in practical steps they can take themselves to prevent and manage common mental health problems such as anxiety, stress and depression. That’s where Every Mind Matters comes in, as a helpful complement to the work of NHS mental health teams and services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePaul Farmer, chief executive of Mind, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eWe all have mental health just as we all have physical health, and it can vary from good to poor.
