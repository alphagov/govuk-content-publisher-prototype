guidance allows NHS trusts to apply to own buildings on their estate where it will help speed up improvements to frontline services.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eHealth Minister Stephen Hammond has announced that \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/requesting-transfers-of-estate-owned-by-nhs-property-companies\"\u003enew guidance on NHS property ownership\u003c/a\u003e will allow NHS trusts and foundation trusts to apply for the transfer of ownership of properties on their estate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is where property on a trust’s estate belongs to NHS Property Services (\u003cabbr title=\"NHS Property Services\"\u003eNHSPS\u003c/abbr\u003e) and Community Health Partnerships (\u003cabbr title=\"Community Health Partnerships\"\u003eCHP\u003c/abbr\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe change recognises that, in many cases, NHS trusts are best placed to judge how to use their estate to benefit the local community. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApplicant trusts will need to put forward business cases showing how owning the property will:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehelp them use their overall estate more efficiently\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eimprove frontline services from existing buildings\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eenable faster decision-making on investment in new wards or patient facilities\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApplications will be subject to approval by the Department of Health and Social Care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe department is already working with 2 trusts to assess the case for the transferring of specific properties:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWest Suffolk Foundation Trust, for Newmarket Hospital\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eDorset Healthcare Foundation Trust, for Boscombe and Springbourne Health Centre\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing NHS reforms in 2013 and the end of primary care trusts, a large number of properties were passed to \u003cabbr title=\"NHS Property Services\"\u003eNHSPS\u003c/abbr\u003e and \u003cabbr title=\"Community Health Partnerships\"\u003eCHP\u003c/abbr\u003e to reduce running costs and release cash for reinvestment back into the NHS through the sale of surplus assets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe presumption that some of the property transferred to trusts in 2013 can automatically revert to \u003cabbr title=\"NHS Property Services\"\u003eNHSPS\u003c/abbr\u003e will also be removed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"NHS Property Services\"\u003eNHSPS\u003c/abbr\u003e and \u003cabbr title=\"Community Health Partnerships\"\u003eCHP\u003c/abbr\u003e will continue to hold significant portfolios of NHS property and will continue to be expert providers of property-related services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHealth Minister Stephen Hammond said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eOur Long Term Plan for the NHS sets out how we will ensure people get the most appropriate care in the most appropriate setting, and to achieve that we need to make the best use of our NHS estate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThis change will empower trusts to make decisions based on the needs of the local community and deliver faster improvements to frontline services for patients, all while getting the best value for money for taxpayers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eIt will support trusts to invest
