CMA has found that JD Sports’ takeover of close competitor Footasylum could be bad for shoppers.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is concerned that the loss of competition brought about by the merger could result in a worse deal for customers, both in-store and online, through higher prices, worse choice in stores or reductions in service quality. JD Sports must now address the concerns identified or face a further, more in-depth, investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJD Sports and Footasylum both sell sports-inspired casual clothing and footwear in stores across the UK, and through their apps and websites. JD Sports agreed to buy Footasylum in a £90 million deal announced earlier this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, UK consumers spent more than £5 billion on sports clothing and footwear. Sportswear is currently a significant influence on fashion trends, with sports styles replacing traditional casualwear, particularly among younger shoppers. Retailers carefully curate the selection of brands that they offer, and develop attention-grabbing offerings in-store and online, in order to compete for customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith over 400 stores, JD Sports is well-established as the leading UK retailer of sports fashion footwear and clothing. It already owns several well-known sports fashion brands on the UK high street – such as Size?, Scotts, Tessuti and Footpatrol, in addition to its signature JD brand – and generated revenues of over £2.14 billion in 2018 in the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince opening its first store in 2006, Footasylum has experienced strong market share growth and now operates around 70 stores across the UK. Footasylum generated revenues of close to £200 million in 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CMA’s initial, Phase 1, investigation has found that the merger could remove one of JD Sports’ closest competitors. While a wide variety of retailers sell sports clothing and footwear, the merging businesses are 2 of a smaller number of firms who have the brand relationships and market presence to be able to credibly meet the demands of sports fashion customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eColin Raftery, Senior Director at the CMA, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eJD Sports is already by far the largest player in the growing sports fashion sector, so any deal that results in it buying up one of its closest competitors could clearly give cause for concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eOur investigation has shown us that JD Sports and Footasylum have been competing strongly across the UK, with a sports fashion offering that few other retailers are able to match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThat’s why we’re concerned this deal could lead to higher prices, less choice and a worse shopping experience for customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJD Sports must now address the CMA’s concerns. If it is unable to do so, the merger will be referred for an in-depth (Phase 2) investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information, visit the JD Sports Fashion plc / Footasylum plc merger \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/jd-sports-fashion-plc-footasylum-plc-merger-inquiry\"\u003einquiry page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d80d5a0ed915d522c447027/jdsports.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d80d59440f0b61cceea1f96/jdsports.jpg","alt_text":"Photograph of a woman in sports wear tying her shoe laces","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-09-18T09:43:45.131Z"}]}}
