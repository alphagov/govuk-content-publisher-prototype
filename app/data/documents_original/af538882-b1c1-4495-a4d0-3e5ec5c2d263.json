more than a metre when part of nearby St James’ Weir washed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe large presence of salmon makes the River Exe one of the most valuable rivers in Devon and Cornwall.

As salmon are attracted to strong currents, 48 bags of rocks – each weighing four tons – have been put into the river to channel salmon along the weir to the pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image embedded\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d76077140f0b6092afc44f1/stone-bags.JPG\" alt=\"Three giant bags of rock stacked and waiting to be winched into the water\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eBags of rock, each weighing 4 tons, will channel salmon to the pass\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCameras at the top of the fish pass will collect data before and after the extension is built, to let us know if the temporary extension is helping fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe next step is to design an extension for the eel pass as elvers cannot ascend the weir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Environment Agency is looking at the long-term options for St James’ Weir with Exeter City Council, which was damaged by high winter flows shortly after Christmas 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d7606c840f0b6094e695657/trews-weir-fish-pass-being-extended.JPG","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d7606c840f0b6092dabaf58/trews-weir-fish-pass-being-extended.JPG","alt_text":"Workmen in the river bolting the fish pass extension into place","caption":"The 7.3m extension to the Trews Weir fish pass is bolted into place","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-09-09T08:16:46.146Z"},{"note":"Video added.","public_timestamp":"2019-09-12T09:36:07.392Z"}]}}
