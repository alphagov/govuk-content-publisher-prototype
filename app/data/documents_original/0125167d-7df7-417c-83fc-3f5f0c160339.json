This, along with further building works, will be subject to government working through the best-value-for-money options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 10,000 places will be in addition to the new prisons that have already been announced, at Wellingborough and Glen Parva, which will provide 3,360 places by 2023. The new funding will also be used to bring previously decommissioned prison places back into use through extensive refurbishment and maintenance work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis major investment builds upon the Prime Minister’s commitment to recruit 20,000 more frontline police officers over the next 3 years – to protect the public and cut crime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnsuring prisons have sufficient capacity to hold the additional offenders who will be caught, charged and sentenced is a crucial part of the government’s effort to create a more effective justice system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eModern prisons also provide better opportunities to reform criminals.
