Competition and Markets Authority has today published its Annual Report. ","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cma-annual-report-and-accounts-2018-to-2019\"\u003eThe report\u003c/a\u003e looks back on the work the CMA carried out during 2018/19, and highlights the tangible impact it has had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of its focus over the past year, the CMA prioritised protecting vulnerable customers,  investigated issues including the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/pharmaceuticals-suspected-anti-competitive-agreements-and-conduct\"\u003esupply of hydrocortisone tablets to the NHS\u003c/a\u003e, the \u003ca

href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vulnerable-consumers\"\u003ea programme of research\u003c/a\u003e to better understand consumer vulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CMA also tackled issues that directly impact everyday life. It reviewed and subsequently blocked the proposed merger between \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/j-sainsbury-plc-asda-group-ltd-merger-inquiry\"\u003eSainsbury’s and Asda\u003c/a\u003e, finding that this deal would have led to increased prices for consumers. It responded to a super-complaint from Citizens Advice about the ‘\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/loyalty-penalty-super-complaint\"\u003eloyalty penalty\u003c/a\u003e’, announcing a package of urgent recommendations to tackle an issue that affects millions of consumers each year.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDigital markets were also a priority and the CMA worked to improve outcomes for consumers in markets as diverse as \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/secondary-ticketing-websites\"\u003esecondary ticketing\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/social-media-endorsements\"\u003ecelebrity endorsements\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/online-dating-services\"\u003eonline dating\u003c/a\u003e.

The \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-clears-paypal-izettle-deal\"\u003ePaypal/iZettle\u003c/a\u003e merger was investigated and cleared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CMA investigated markets which underpin and enable economic growth, building on its work in markets of central significance to a well-functioning economy. It reviewed the £1.6 trillion \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/investment-consultants-market-investigation\"\u003einvestment consultancy and fiduciary management sector\u003c/a\u003e ensuring that this sector works better for pension scheme members, and made a number of recommendations to improve the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/statutory-audit-market-study\"\u003estatutory audit market\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlongside its casework, the CMA focussed in 2018/19 on preparing to play a bigger role on the world stage following the UK’s exit from the EU. It also developed a package of \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/reforms-proposed-to-put-consumers-at-the-heart-of-uk-competition-regime\"\u003eproposed reforms\u003c/a\u003e to competition and consumer protection law to respond to the challenges of the digital economy and declining confidence in market competition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CMA has a UK-wide remit with its main office in London and offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In May 2018, it opened an expanded office in Edinburgh, which has now grown to more than 40 staff; it also plans modest expansions in Belfast and Cardiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d30752a40f0b64a84cda4a2/cma-staff.png","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d30752940f0b64a785c5089/cma-staff.png","alt_text":"photograph: people stood talking at the CMA.","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-07-18T13:33:30.944Z"}]}}
