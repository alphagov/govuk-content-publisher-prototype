they are spotting warning signs early enough, was today (10 July 2019) launched by Communities Secretary Rt Hon James Brokenshire MP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe major work will examine the effectiveness of local authority financial reporting and audit regime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a speech at the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy’s (\u003cabbr title=\"Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy\"\u003eCIPFA\u003c/abbr\u003e’s) annual conference Public Finance Live, the Communities Secretary Rt Hon James Brokenshire MP said there are far reaching consequences when audits aren’t carried out properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eA robust local audit system is absolutely pivotal to work on oversight, not just because it reinforces confidence in financial reporting but also service delivery and, ultimately, our faith in local democracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThere are potentially far-reaching consequences when audits aren’t carried out properly and they fail to detect significant problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eI am delighted Sir Tony Redmond will be leading this work and I await his report towards the end of this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal authorities in England are responsible for 22% of total UK public sector expenditure so the way local authorities report their accounts must be of the highest level of transparency and quality. The review will also look at how councils publish their annual accounts and if their financial reporting system is sufficiently transparent to be held to account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe review will be led by the former President of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance Sir Tony Redmond. Sir Tony is a former local authority Treasurer and Chief Executive. He has also worked as a Local Government Boundary Commissioner and held the post of Local Government Ombudsman, along with a number of non-executive positions in the public and third sectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring his speech, the Communities Secretary will confirm the review will look at the quality of the audit of local authorities, whether auditors are using their reporting powers correctly and if councils are heeding recommendations to help improve the financial management of their accounts. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe review will also look at whether there is an ‘expectation gap’ between what taxpayers believe an audit will deliver, and what it can in reality deliver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSir Tony Redmond is expected to report to the Communities Secretary with his initial recommendations in December 2019, with a final report published in March 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRead the full \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-local-authority-financial-reporting-and-external-audit-terms-of-reference\"\u003eterms of reference\u003c/a\u003e of the review.
