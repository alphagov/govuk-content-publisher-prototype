guide 19 section 3.1.1\u003c/a\u003e will take effect. This states:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eA consent must state it is given to registration of the disposition, rather than simply consenting to the disposition itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen requesting consent from the party named in the restriction, customers will need to make it clear that they require consent to registration. And third parties giving consent must state they give consent to registration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRestrictions in the register make it clear when the powers of the proprietor are limited, or a prior condition must be met before a disposition can be registered. Consenting to registration, rather than the disposition itself, will ensure the requirements of the Land Registration Act 2002 are met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe understand that customers get consents to registration from third parties, and so we are giving customers 12 monthsâ€™ notice to embed this practice. From April 2020, applications with incorrectly worded consents will receive an application enquiry (requisition).  We have updated practice guide 19 to clarify our requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information, see \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notices-restrictions-and-the-protection-of-third-party-interests-in-the-register\"\u003epractice guide 19: notices, restrictions and the protection of third-party interests in the register\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c7e557140f0b603d205aa6e/practise-guide-png.JPG","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c7e5570ed915d406878f612/practise-guide-png.JPG","alt_text":"Monitor displaying practise guide 19","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-03-05T10:55:57.084Z"}]}}
