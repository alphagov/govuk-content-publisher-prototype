that there is no increased risk to health from the aftermath of the fire.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe levels of chemicals found in the Grenfell area are consistent with those generally found in London. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe checks were carried out by independent specialists and have been verified by experts on the independent Science Advisory Group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe process for carrying out the checks was agreed by all members of the Science Advisory Group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor Anna Stec, who originally suggested testing around the site, is a former member of the Group who provided advice to the group on fire toxicity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSir Patrick Vallance, Government Chief Scientific Adviser and Chairman of the Science Advisory Group said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eFollowing a review of the technical documents by the Science Advisory Group, they have agreed that the approach taken was scientifically rigorous and met the agreed specification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThe Group has confidence in the results from Stage 1, which will inform the Stage 2 investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo provide further reassurance to the community, a second stage of testing will also be carried out. The Stage 1 results do not show levels requiring any change to the investigation strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone in the Grenfell community who remains concerned about their health should contact their GP, who is best placed to assess individual needs and consider the most appropriate treatment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMore information can also be found about the enhanced health checks that are available.  The government has provided £50 million funding to provide additional health services to the community to support this work. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHealth checks are also available at various clinics in North Kensington via community provider, Enhance, who can be reached on 020 3434 2500.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"further-information\"\u003eFurther information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-we-did-in-stage-1\"\u003eWhat we did in Stage 1\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe aim of Stage 1 was to collect background information, including thorough research, a site walkover and samples from selected public areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInvestigators took 93 samples from 21 areas within a 1km radius of the Tower, including the Grenfell Tower site. The areas were decided with the community’s help to identify where debris from the fire had been found, together with scientific data from the Met Office about the smoke plume from the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-the-tests-found\"\u003eWhat the tests found\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost substances tested are at levels expected in London. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe substances found in the soil are unlikely to be present as a unique result of the fire and most would be present in the environment despite the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are no obvious patterns in the spread or levels of the substances found – if substances were present in the soil because of the fire, we would expect to see much higher levels closer to the Tower and spreading outwards, but the checks did not find this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere some substances are at higher levels, this does not mean they necessarily present a risk to health – the levels are consistent with those in other urban areas. Findings at these levels do not require action, but we will continue to investigate them in a second stage of testing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe results from Stage 1 will help us to agree where to test and what to test for in the next stage. Stage 2, which involves further sampling, will proceed as planned so we can provide further reassurance to the community. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/grenfell-environmental-checks-stage-1-report#report-documents\"\u003efull results of the Stage 1 checks\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/grenfell-environmental-checks-stage-1-report#summary-of-report-and-next-steps\"\u003esummary of the results\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/science-advisory-group-terms-of-reference--2\"\u003eScience Advisory Group’s terms of reference\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_c1f13fd8-9feb-4028-9323-7cb3383323b4\" class=\"contact\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003eMedia enquiries\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"email\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eEmail\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003ca href=\"mailto:newsdesk@communities.gov.uk\" class=\"email\"\u003enewsdesk@communities.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003ePlease use this number if you are a journalist wishing to speak to Press Office\u003c/span\u003e\n          0303 444 1209\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_bfc00333-a9ee-4ca1-9d3c-432dbcdf4640\" class=\"contact postal-address\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003eOffice address and general enquiries\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n      \u003cp class=\"adr\"\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"street-address\"\u003e2 Marsham Street\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLondon\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"postal-code\"\u003eSW1P 4DF\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"contact_form_url\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eContact form\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003ca href=\"https://forms.communities.gov.uk/\"\u003ehttps://forms.communit...\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eGeneral enquiries:  please use this number if you are a member of the public\u003c/span\u003e\n          030 3444 0000\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_f375ee5c-c7f3-4e09-9ba8-2ca0308481c5\" class=\"contact\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003eSocial media - MHCLG\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n      \u003cp class=\"comments\"\u003eTwitter - \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mhclg\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/mhclg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFlickr - \u003ca href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mhclg\"\u003ehttp://www.flickr.com/photos/mhclg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLinkedIn - \u003ca href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/company/mhclg\"\u003ehttp://www.linkedin.com/company/mhclg\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d9f4580ed915d39a35131b5/soil-testing-960.png","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d9f457fed915d3549991a0b/soil-testing-960.png","alt_text":"Photo showing soil testing","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-10-10T14:53:32.490Z"}]}}
