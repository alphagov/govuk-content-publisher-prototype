training on homelessness is being delivered to hundreds of jobcentre managers in a crucial move to improve support for vulnerable benefit claimants.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThe Department for

homeless, get access to all relevant services offered by the department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe managers will also act as a point of contact for partner homelessness organisations in their local area, focusing on building relationships with them and ensuring people are signposted appropriately to additional, expert support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is in addition to the support already available, which includes helping homeless people to verify their ID to set up claims for benefits, assistance with opening bank accounts and pausing requirements to look for work so they can concentrate on finding stable housing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWill Quince, Minister for Family Support, Housing and Child Maintenance, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“People experiencing homelessness are some of the most vulnerable in society and we are determined to help them access the best possible support and improve their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Our jobcentre work coaches do an excellent job providing a tailored service for homeless people, including finding secure housing and helping them claim Universal Credit. Our newly trained Customer Service Managers will be instrumental in sharing best practice and building crucial links to local organisations and to ensure a joined-up package of support for our claimants.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJon Sparkes, Chief Executive at Crisis, said: “Homelessness is something we know can be ended across the country with the right policies and solutions in place. The Jobcentre Plus network has a pivotal role to play in this; especially in identifying and responding to people’s housing needs quickly, ideally before they become homeless in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The roll out of training to all staff represents a positive first step in ensuring people facing homelessness receive the right support at a time when they need it most. By helping to shape this training we hope it will ensure that front line jobcentre staff are better equipped work with people experiencing homelessness. This also provides a good foundation for potentially growing housing and homelessness expertise amongst dedicated staff in local jobcentres where there is greatest homelessness demand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTraining will be fully completed across Great Britain by the end of August.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJobcentre Customer Service Managers provide crucial support to customers with complex needs and will support work coaches to identify and recognise the needs of people who are experiencing homelessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe delivery follows a pledge to do so in the government’s rough sleeping strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"more-information\"\u003eMore information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLast year DWP created \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/universal-credit-and-homeless-people\"\u003e2 guides specifically to help people experiencing homelessness access Universal Credit\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"contact-press-office\"\u003eContact Press Office\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMedia enquiries for this press release – 020 3267 5144\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_df0a78d2-6122-46ac-8014-6f8c5e0b8d3f\" class=\"contact postal-address\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003ePress Office\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n      \u003cp class=\"adr\"\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"street-address\"\u003eCaxton House\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTothill Street\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"locality\"\u003eLondon\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"postal-code\"\u003eSW1H 9NA\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eLondon Press Office (national media and London area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims)\u003c/span\u003e\n          020 3267 5144\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eOut-of-hours (journalists only)\u003c/span\u003e\n          07623 928 975\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eEngland and Wales (local media enquiries)\u003c/span\u003e\n          029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eScotland (local media enquiries)\u003c/span\u003e\n          0131 310 1122\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollow DWP on:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dwp\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dwp\"\u003eLinkedIn\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dwp\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-07-22T15:22:26.850Z"}]}}
