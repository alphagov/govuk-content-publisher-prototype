CMA has found that woollen yarn producer Danspin’s purchase of competitor Lawton Yarns poses serious competition concerns for carpet manufacturers in the UK.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been investigating the completed merger of Danspin and Lawton Yarns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBoth companies provide yarn that is used to make woollen carpets nationally and across the world. In the UK - one of the biggest markets for this particular carpet - Danspin and Lawton Yarns supply the majority of yarn used in its manufacturing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn its initial “Phase 1” investigation, the CMA has found that, as well as being the 2 main producers of woollen yarn prior to their merger, Danspin and Lawton Yarns were each other’s main competitors and faced little rivalry from other businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eChoice for carpet manufacturers following the merger would therefore be particularly limited, as the other main competitors in this sector have a small UK presence and would not pose a healthy challenge to the merged company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result, the CMA is concerned that the new, merged company could increase prices or reduce the supply of yarn to carpet manufacturers in the UK, potentially pushing prices up for people buying woollen carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDanspin bought Lawton Yarns out of administration in May 2019, following a competitive process against other interested purchasers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDanspin has until 12 November to offer solutions to resolve the CMA’s concerns, otherwise the merger will be referred for an in-depth “Phase 2” investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMore information can be found on the CMA’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/danspin-a-s-lawton-yarns-limited-merger-inquiry\"\u003eDanspin/Lawton Yarns web page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dc1517fed915d1d07006f38/istock-1050235876.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dc1517ced915d1d0b72e1c7/istock-1050235876.jpg","alt_text":"Yarn being manufactured.","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-11-05T10:40:00.162Z"}]}}
