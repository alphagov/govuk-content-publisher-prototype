Agency starts weekly spot sampling to help inform improvements","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eAn extensive programme of testing is being carried out around Bridlington in a bid to find out sources impacting on bathing water quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Environment Agency has started weekly spot sampling at a number of points in Bridlington Bay, including at permitted effluent discharges, the harbour and the Gypsey Race to try and get a better understanding of the water quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt also plans to do a day of intensive sampling across a full tidal cycle at numerous set points along Bridlington North and South Bays to provide a better understanding of bathing water quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe monitoring is in addition to the weekly compliance sampling already taken from each bay as part of the Environment Agency’s national bathing water quality sampling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBathing water quality at North Bay is classified as ‘Good’ but South Bay dropped from ‘Good’ to ‘Sufficient’ in the 2018 season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe samples collected from the harbour and Gypsey Race will aim to identify their connectivity with the bathing water quality in the bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eClaire Campbell, of the Environment Agency, said: “We are carrying out a monitoring programme in Bridlington to look at bathing beaches and the things that affect water quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eWhere bacteria levels are high in a sample we will undertake further analysis to try and identify the source of the bacteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eOver time we will build a data set to better understand what impacts on bathing water quality, from people, birds and dogs to combined sewers, drains, tides, as well as the weather and industrial processes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWe will also continue to work with landowners, partners including local authorities and Yorkshire Water to make improvements where we can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMs Campbell added that the public also has a part to play in keeping bathing waters clean, including by not feeding seagulls, cleaning up after dogs and disposing of litter correctly. She said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eEveryone has a part to play in protecting and improving our great bathing waters. If we continue to work together to reduce pollution, we can improve water quality and ensure our bathing waters and coastal communities continue to thrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo check bathing water quality and for further information about what affects it, go to \u003ca href=\"http://www.gov.uk/quality-of-local-bathing-water\"\u003ewww.gov.uk/quality-of-local-bathing-water\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d692bb7ed915d53ab155cf7/brid-harbour-sampling.JPG","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d692bb740f0b607c1d0b5a9/brid-harbour-sampling.JPG","alt_text":"Man sampling water","caption":"Spot samples are being taken to understand factors that affect bathing water quality","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-08-30T13:59:20.464Z"}]}}
