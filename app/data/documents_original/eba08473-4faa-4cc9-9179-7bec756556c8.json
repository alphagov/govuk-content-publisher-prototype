to take out a mortgage with a term of more than 25 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the changes, which are taking effect immediately, people will have the freedom to reduce their monthly

out a mortgage of more than 30 years has doubled in the last decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt present, when re-mortgaging after 2 or 5 years at the end of a fixed rate period, Help to Buy
