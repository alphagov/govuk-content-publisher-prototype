of primary school starters urged to check immunisation records.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eAs hundreds of thousands of parents across England prepare their children to start primary school in the next few weeks, Public Health England (\u003cabbr title=\"Public Health England\"\u003ePHE\u003c/abbr\u003e) is warning that one in seven 5 year olds may not be fully up-to-date with some routine immunisations, with the figure rising to around one in four children in London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese worrying estimates, released as part of \u003cabbr title=\"Public Health England\"\u003ePHE\u003c/abbr\u003e’s Value of Vaccines campaign, show that some 4 and 5 year olds are starting school at unnecessary risk of serious diseases compared to the majority of their classmates, prompting a call for parents to check their child’s Red Book to ensure their children are up-to-date with scheduled immunisations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the UK, dose 1 of the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/mmr-vaccine/\"\u003eMMR\u003c/a\u003e vaccine, which protects against Measles, Mumps and Rubella, is usually given to infants at around 12 months of age. A second dose is given before school, usually at 3 years and 4 months of age, to ensure best protection. Two doses of MMR in a lifetime are needed for a person to be considered fully protected. The \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/4-in-1-pre-school-dtap-ipv-booster/\"\u003e4-in-1 pre-school booster\u003c/a\u003e is also usually offered at 3 years and 4 months of age and protects against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and polio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAround 680,000 5-year-olds start school in England each year according to \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-school-and-pupil-numbers\"\u003eDepartment for Education figures\u003c/a\u003e.

Almost 30,000 of these children are in London, meaning that around one in four primary school starters in the capital don’t have the full protection that the MMR vaccine offers\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003earound 100,000 (or one in eight) 5 year olds in England may still need their 4-in-1 pre-school booster that protects against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and polio\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis means that more than 5% of 5 year olds are starting reception year having not received any MMR. This leaves them at high risk of measles at a time when outbreaks of the disease are occurring across the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at \u003cabbr title=\"Public Health England\"\u003ePHE\u003c/abbr\u003e, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eIt’s a real concern that so many young children – as many as a quarter of a reception class in some areas – could be starting school without the full protection that the NHS childhood immunisation programme offers for free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWe know that parents want the best protection for their children and so many may be unaware that their child is not up-to-date. We’re urging all parents of primary school starters to check their child’s Red Book now to make sure there is a record of two MMR doses and the 4-in-1 booster vaccine. If not, parents should contact their GP practice to arrange any further vaccinations that are needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eWe’re particularly concerned about children being at greater risk of measles. We’re continuing to see outbreaks of the disease occurring in communities across the country, many linked to visiting European countries over the summer holidays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThe vast majority of those affected are not fully immunised and vaccine preventable diseases spread more easily in schools. It’s crucial that children have maximum protection as they begin to mix with other children at the start of their school journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWe often think that these diseases are confined to the past, but the World Health Organisation has recently confirmed that measles is no longer eliminated in England. Whilst tetanus and polio are still rare thanks to the success of the NHS childhood immunisation programme, over the past few years we’ve also seen cases of whooping cough and diphtheria in school-aged children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo check that your child has received all their vaccines on schedule, visit the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/nhs-vaccinations-and-when-to-have-them/\"\u003eNHS website\u003c/a\u003e and refer to your child’s Red Book.
