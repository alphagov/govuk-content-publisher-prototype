we are\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn 25 August 2019 in Manchester, something great happened. We flew the flags and righteously supported the Manchester \u003cabbr title=\"lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, and others\"\u003eLGBTQ+\u003c/abbr\u003e community. We marched with colleagues from BPDTS, the Department for Work and Pensions, \u003cabbr title=\"Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs\"\u003eHMRC\u003c/abbr\u003e, Home Office and many other government departments under one unified banner – A Proud Civil Service. We stood strong and shoulder to shoulder with our civil service allies and told Manchester just how proud we are of our \u003cabbr title=\"lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, and others\"\u003eLGBTQ+\u003c/abbr\u003e colleagues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe theme of the day was deep space, imagining a world with total equality. From inflatable aliens, to pink wigs, bubble guns, gender bending cyborgs right through to what matters… smiles from ear to ear, we celebrated bursting with pride about who we are, what we do and where we come from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image embedded\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d8b2698ed915d0366859018/manchester-pride.jpg\" alt=\"Civil Service Pride at Manchester Pride\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"naturally-inclusive\"\u003eNaturally Inclusive\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCreating a naturally inclusive environment where people can be themselves, thrive, celebrate their differences and succeed is so important to us at BPDTS. Our goal is to make diversity and inclusion part of everything we do, rooted deep into our culture, policies, strategies and the way our people think and act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDiversity to us, means understanding that each person is unique and individual. We recognise these differences and acknowledge that they may be visible and they may not. Differences can include anything from gender and ethnicity through to beliefs, disability, sexuality and family status.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInclusion to us, means understanding and valuing individual differences. We strive to build a culture within our organisation for our people to prosper and flourish. This means our individuals are supported, respected, engaged, have a voice, and are able to develop skills and talents in line with BPDTS’s values, aims and goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy creating an environment in which people can be authentic and true to themselves, we’ll help them to unlock their potential and support them to be their very best. Working with colleagues from diverse backgrounds will bring fresh ideas, make us more creative and innovative - and we’ll deliver more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe help build digital solutions for a rich and diverse nation, so we want the diversity of our people to reflect this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image embedded\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d8b2699e5274a08c282dfe1/manchester-pride-2.jpg\" alt=\"Civil Service Pride at Manchester Pride\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"proud-of-what-we-have-done-so-far\"\u003eProud of what we have done so far\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past few years we have worked hard to build the foundations of an organisation where diversity and inclusion runs through our DNA. Whilst we have ambitious plans as to how much more we want to do, we’re proud of the progress we have made to date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eour BPDTS Women in Digital Network run events across the country promoting and supporting women in digital and technology roles\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewe’ve been awarded Disability Confident Employer status\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewe have an apprenticeship scheme in place, encouraging a wider range of people to embark upon a digital career or progress within the digital community, regardless of socio-economic background\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etrained mental health first aiders to support our people who are both living with mental health issues and caring for those who experience mental issues\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewe’ve worked closely with other areas of the civil service to ensure our people have access to some really great and established people networks\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewe’ve signed and committed to the Tech Talent Charter – a commitment by organisations to a set of undertakings that aim to deliver greater inclusion and diversity in the UK tech workforce\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"our-diversity-and-inclusion-strategy\"\u003eOur Diversity and Inclusion Strategy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut we know that there is much more to do. So we’ve developed a Diversity and Inclusion Strategy that sets out what we’ll do to embed our approach and commitment to diversity and inclusion. For 2019 to 2020 we will focus on 3 main areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"supporting-our-people\"\u003eSupporting our people\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis means being able to be who we are, recognising our differences and respecting each other. It’s about listening to each other and letting people be heard, raising our awareness of our individual and collective needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"creating-our-environment\"\u003eCreating our environment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCreating the kind of place where we all want to work, free from discrimination and harassment, with fair working practices and where we can feedback.

This also needs to include opportunities that come up internally and for people returning to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnderpinning and delivering this strategy will be an action plan delivered by our Diversity and Inclusion Group and people networks, self-organising teams of volunteers, dedicating time to delivering our goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJoe Tetley, Diversity and Inclusion Group chair says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWe want everyone at BPDTS to be happy in the workplace and to be able to be who they are.
