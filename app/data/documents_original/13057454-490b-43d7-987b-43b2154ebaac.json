government has started a consultation to transform support for sick and disabled staff and remove barriers for employers.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eToday (Monday 15 July) Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd and Health Secretary Matt Hancock are setting out new measures to transform how employers support and retain disabled staff and those with a health condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the new measures the lowest paid employees would be eligible for Statutory Sick Pay for the first time, while small businesses may be offered a sick pay rebate to reward those who effectively manage employees on sick leave and help them get back to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach year more than 100,000 people leave their job following a period of sickness absence lasting at least 4 weeks, new figures show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe longer somebody is on sickness absence the more likely they are to fall out of work, with 44% of people who had been off sick for a year then leaving employment altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWork and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eI want Britain to be an environment where disabled people and those with health conditions can thrive, not just survive – not only in work but every area of their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eWith 3 in 5 employers facing challenges when supporting employees to return to work, it’s time that we took a closer look at how businesses can retain staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eGood work is good for our mental and physical health, and by working closely with employers we can help prevent the loss of talent when people unnecessarily leave the workplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBusinesses and health providers will be asked for their views on how to remove the barriers in the current system which stop employers from taking action, with small employers expected to need the most support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe majority of small employers reported a lack of time and capital to invest in support as the key issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government will also consider whether to change legal guidance to encourage employers to intervene early during a period of sickness absence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eToo many still face challenges returning to work after sick leave. We need to remove the barriers that stop people with disabilities or health conditions from reaching their full potential – these steps will help us achieve that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eBusinesses will also benefit from being able to retain talent, and build workplaces that support the physical and mental health needs of their employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile government can help create the right conditions, employers are best placed to take the small actions that help disabled people and those with health conditions to remain in work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEvidence shows that early intervention by an employer is important in reducing the number of people leaving the workforce for health reasons. Employers can use simple, low-cost measures such as making flexible adjustments to someone’s working pattern or keeping in touch with people while they are on sick leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCBI Chief UK Policy Director Matthew Fell said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eManaging sickness absence effectively and reducing it through proactive health and wellbeing initiatives and policies makes good business sense.
