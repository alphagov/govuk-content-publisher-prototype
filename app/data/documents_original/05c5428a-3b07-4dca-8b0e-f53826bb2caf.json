It will aim to help vulnerable people, including disabled people, care leavers and those with mental health issues, claim Universal Credit as a route into work. It will support innovative ideas for engaging with vulnerable people early, helping them to make timely claims to the new benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFigures show that a fifth of claimants delayed making a claim for Universal Credit, largely because they didn’t know how to make a claim or because they thought they would find a job quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSecretary of State for Work and Pensions, Dr Therese Coffey MP said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eI am delighted to announce a £10 million challenge fund to support the most vulnerable in society with their Universal Credit claims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eUniversal Credit is now supporting more than 2.5 million people.
