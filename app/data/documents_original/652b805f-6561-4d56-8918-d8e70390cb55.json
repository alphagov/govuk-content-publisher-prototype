People with \u003cabbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\"\u003eHIV\u003c/abbr\u003e now benefit from effective treatments that stop the virus being passed on to sexual partners and the number of people diagnosed late is lower than ever before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eGetting tested for \u003cabbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\"\u003eHIV\u003c/abbr\u003e has never been easier, with free tests available through \u003cabbr title=\"general practitioner (family doctor)\"\u003eGP\u003c/abbr\u003e surgeries, local hospitals and sexual health clinics, as well as through a self-sampling service or by using a self-testing kit.

You can protect yourself from \u003cabbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\"\u003eHIV\u003c/abbr\u003e through consistent and correct condom use with new and casual partners, through using \u003cabbr title=\"pre-exposure prophylaxis\"\u003ePrEP\u003c/abbr\u003e, or if your partner is living with \u003cabbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\"\u003eHIV\u003c/abbr\u003e, through knowing their virus is undetectable.
