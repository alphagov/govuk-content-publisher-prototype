disclose to employers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, some sentences of over four years will no longer have to be disclosed to employers after a specified period of time has passed. This change will not apply where offences attract the most serious sentences, including life, or for serious sexual, violent and terrorism offences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRegular work is a major factor in breaking the cycle of crime but many ex-offenders find it impossible to get a job, with just 17% in employment a year after release from prison, and as half of employers would not consider hiring an ex-offender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the rule change for longer sentences over four years, the period of time for which shorter sentences and community sentences have to be revealed to employers will be scaled back. The exact length of these ‘rehabilitation periods’ will be determined following discussions with stakeholders. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe proposed reforms recognise that the longer someone goes without committing a further crime, the lower the risk they will reoffend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSecretary of State for Justice, David Gauke, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThe responsibility, structure and support provided by regular work is an essential component of effective rehabilitation, something which benefits us all by reducing reoffending and cutting the cost of crime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThat’s why we are introducing reforms to break barriers faced by ex-offenders who genuinely want to turn their lives around through employment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWhile these reforms will help remove the stigma of convictions, we will never compromise public safety.

For example, an individual sentenced to a lengthy sentence for theft half a century ago would still have to tell employers to this day. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis creates a disproportionate barrier to employment which prevents ex-offenders from moving on with their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn his review into the treatment of and outcomes for BAME individuals in the criminal justice system, David Lammy MP found that current rules are “trapping offenders in their past, denying dependents an income, and costing the tax-payer money.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Government has acted in light of his recommendations, as well as those of the Justice Select Committee and of Charlie Taylor made following his review of youth justice. The reforms set out will be introduced as new legislation when parliamentary time becomes available. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey will only apply to non-sensitive roles, with separate and stricter rules for those working with children or vulnerable adults, as well as national security roles or positions of public trust. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"notes-to-editors\"\u003eNotes to Editors\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eDetailed proposals on how we will amend the ‘rehabilitation periods’ for shorter custodial sentences and non-custodial sentences offences will be set out following engagement with stakeholders later this year.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe rules for sensitive roles are subject to a recent Supreme Court judgment, to which the Government will respond later in the year.
