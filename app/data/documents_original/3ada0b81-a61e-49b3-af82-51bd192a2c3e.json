preventing private landlords from evicting tenants at short notice and without good reason\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eStep-change to create open-ended tenancies for all private renters – bringing greater peace of mind to millions of tenants in the private rented sector\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLandlords to have more effective means of getting their property back when they genuinely need to do so\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrivate landlords will no longer be able to evict tenants from their homes at short notice and without good reason, in the biggest change to the private rental sector for a generation, Communities Secretary Rt Hon James Brokenshire MP has announced (15 April 2019).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of a complete overhaul of the sector, the government has outlined plans to consult on new legislation to abolish Section 21 evictions – so called ‘no-fault’ evictions. This will bring an end to private landlords uprooting tenants from their homes with as little as 8 weeks’ notice after the fixed-term contract has come to an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis will effectively create open-ended tenancies, bringing greater peace of mind to millions of families who live in rented accommodation. Many tenants live with the worry of being evicted at short notice or continue to live in poor accommodation for fear they will be asked to leave if they complain about problems with their home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt will give them the reassurance that they will not be suddenly turfed out of their home and reduces the risk of being faced with having nowhere else to go. And evidence shows that the end of tenancies through the Section 21 process is one of the biggest causes of family homelessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe private rented sector has grown rapidly over recent years, with more than 4 million people now living in privately rented accommodation – the vast majority of whom are responsible tenants who pay their rent on time and take good care of the property.  Yet the housing market has not kept pace with the changes in society and leaves many tenants feeling insecure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe proposed measures will provide greater certainty for tenants and make the housing market fit for the 21st century, whilst creating a more secure rental market for landlords in which to remain and invest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrime Minister Theresa May said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eEveryone renting in the private sector has the right to feel secure in their home, settled in their community and able to plan for the future with confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eBut millions of responsible tenants could still be uprooted by their landlord with little notice, and often little justification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThis is wrong – and today we’re acting by preventing these unfair evictions. Landlords will still be able to end tenancies where they have legitimate reasons to do so, but they will no longer be able to unexpectedly evict families with only 8 weeks’ notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThis important step will not only protect tenants from unethical behaviour, but also give them the long-term certainty and the peace of mind they deserve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCommunities Secretary, Rt Hon James Brokenshire MP, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eBy abolishing these kinds of evictions, every single person living in the private rented sector will be empowered to make the right housing choice for themselves – not have it made for them. And this will be balanced by ensuring responsible landlords can get their property back where they have proper reason to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eWe are making the biggest change to the private rental sector in a generation. We are creating homes, opportunities and thriving communities, where people can come together and put down roots, bound by a strong sense of belonging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eEveryone has a right to the opportunities they need to build a better life. For many, this means having the security and stability to make a place truly feel like home without the fear of being evicted at a moments’ notice. We are building a fairer housing market that truly works for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe vast majority of landlords are responsible property owners who provide quality homes and services for their tenants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the proposals, landlords will have to provide a concrete, evidenced reason already specified in law for bringing tenancies to an end  a marked step-change from the current rules which allows landlords to evict tenants at any time after the fixed-term contract has come to an end, and without specifying a reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd to ensure responsible landlords have confidence they will be able to end tenancies where they have legitimate reason to do so, ministers will amend the Section 8 eviction process, so property owners are able to regain their home should they wish to sell it or move into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCourt processes will also be expedited so landlords are able to swiftly and smoothly regain their property in the rare event of tenants falling into rent arrears or damaging the property – meaning landlords have the security of knowing disputes will be resolved quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMinisters will also work with other types of housing providers outside of the private rented sector who use these powers and use the consultation to make sure the new system works effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday’s announcement is the start of a process of engaging with landlords and tenants to amend these grounds in order to make the process work better for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe news comes just weeks before the Tenant Fees Act takes effect on 1 June, which will save tenants across England at least £240 million a year – up to £70 per household – by banning unfair letting fees and capping tenancy deposits at 5 weeks’ rent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new deal for renters is part of a wider package of government reforms aimed at rebalancing the relationship between tenants and landlords to deliver a fairer, better quality and more affordable private rental market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"further-information\"\u003eFurther information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government will shortly launch a new consultation on proposals to remove the ability of landlords to use ‘no fault’ evictions under Section 21 of the 1988 Housing Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government will collaborate with and listen to tenants, landlords and others in the private rented sector to develop a new deal for renting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government has today published its response to its consultation on \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/overcoming-the-barriers-to-longer-tenancies-in-the-private-rented-sector\"\u003eOvercoming the barriers to longer tenancies in the private rented sector\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government committed to consult on overcoming the barriers to longer tenancies in the private rented sector in the 2017 Autumn Budget. The consultation ran for 8 weeks and closed in August 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn October 2017, the then Secretary of State committed to consult the Judiciary on whether to introduce a new specialist Housing Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe recently ran a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/considering-the-case-for-a-housing-court-call-for-evidence\"\u003ecall for evidence\u003c/a\u003e to better understand and improve the experience of people using courts and tribunal services in property cases, including considering the case for a specialist Housing Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis ran from 13 November 2018 to 22 January 2019. We are currently analysing the responses and will be publishing our response in due course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 2018 English Housing Survey found that in 2017 to 2018 there were an estimated 23.3 million households in England.
