Business Strategy, shows how we have worked with a range of partners over the last 12 months to help deliver on our ambition to become the world’s leading land registry for speed, simplicity and an open approach to data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last year our transformation has seen us roll out our innovative digital mortgage service to a range of high-street lenders, making it
