firm Aspen has offered to pay the NHS £8m, as part of a wider package, to resolve competition concerns over the supply of a vital medicine.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThis follows an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into suspected anti-competitive arrangements regarding the supply of  fludrocortisone acetate  0.1  mg tablets. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the first time the CMA will secure such a payment to the NHS in one of its pharmaceutical investigations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFludrocortisone is a life-saving medicine, on which thousands of patients depend. It is supplied only on prescription, mainly to treat primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, commonly known as Addison’s Disease. It is paid for by the NHS and so ultimately by UK taxpayers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CMA has been investigating arrangements  that Aspen entered into with 2  rival pharmaceutical companies  in 2016,  as the CMA suspected competition law had been broken by Aspen paying  competitors to stay out of the market. These arrangements left Aspen as the sole supplier of fludrocortisone, with the ability to set prices without facing any competition. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result of the CMA’s investigation, Aspen recently approached the CMA with an offer to try and resolve the case. After securing changes, the CMA is now announcing the proposed package, which includes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAdmission of illegality: Aspen admits it was party to an illegal, anti-competitive agreement, by way of settlement.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCompensation to address CMA’s concerns: Aspen will commit to pay £8 million to the NHS – without the Government having to launch court proceedings for damages.  This is intended to address the CMA’s concerns that as a result of the impact of Aspen’s behaviour, the NHS paid a higher price for fludrocortisone.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRestoring competition: Aspen will also commit to ensuring that, in future, there will be at least 2 suppliers of fludrocortisone in the UK. This aims to address the competition concerns identified by the CMA and provide the NHS with the opportunity to secure better value for money when purchasing this medicine.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eFine: Aspen will pay a maximum fine of £2.1 million,  once the  CMA has concluded its investigation, if it reaches a formal decision that the law has been broken. The CMA is continuing its investigation given other companies are involved.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAndrea Coscelli, the CMA’s Chief Executive, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eThe CMA launched this investigation because we consider it unacceptable  for the NHS – and the taxpayers who fund it -  to have to pay millions of pounds more than they should for this life-saving drug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThis is the first time a CMA investigation  will secure  a payment  for the NHS. The £8 million Aspen has agreed to provide will save  the NHS the time and expense of seeking damages in court. Importantly, Aspen has also committed to ensuring there are more competitors in this market, giving the NHS the opportunity to secure better value for UK taxpayers’ money in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWe welcome Aspen approaching us to find  a new way of addressing the CMA’s  concerns. We believe this resolution will benefit the NHS, patients and taxpayers. Meanwhile we continue to investigate the 2 other companies we suspect illegally participated in this arrangement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CMA is required to consult interested parties before accepting commitments which it considers address its competition concerns, and so it is today consulting on the proposals to pay the NHS and resolve competition in the market. These parties have until 5pm on Monday 2 September 2019  to respond to the consultation, after which the CMA will decide whether to accept the commitments. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CMA currently has other, unrelated investigations open in relation to 6 other pharmaceutical drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMore information on this investigation can be found on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/pharmaceutical-drugs-suspected-anti-competitive-agreements-and-conduct\"\u003ePharmaceutical drugs: suspected anti-competitive agreements and conduct page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_3c14b55f-b630-4089-85e9-62503358857c\" class=\"contact\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003eMedia enquiries\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"email\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eEmail\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003ca href=\"mailto:press@cma.gov.uk\" class=\"email\"\u003epress@cma.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003ePress office\u003c/span\u003e\n          020 3738 6460\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eOut-of-hours mobile (for urgent media requests only) \u003c/span\u003e\n          07774 134814\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003cp class=\"comments\"\u003eDuring working hours, please contact the main press office number.

Aspen has offered to resolve this part of the case by way of a proposed commitment to pay £8 million to the NHS and ensure that there will be at least 2 suppliers in the market. In order to fulfil the latter commitment, Aspen has committed to divest the fludrocortisone product acquired in October 2016 and reintroduce and commercialise  its other fludrocortisone product in the UK.  The CMA is  today publishing its Notice of Intention to Accept Binding Commitments.  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe total payment of £8 million will be  allocated between the Department of Health and Social Care in England and the equivalent bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland  in accordance with the Barnett formula. The payment is expected to save the NHS time and money as  the NHS would  otherwise need to engage in court proceedings to claim damages. The payment does not preclude the  NHS from seeking further damages if it considers doing so to be appropriate.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAspen has also admitted to participating in an  historic market-sharing agreement  involving  fludrocortisone. The CMA is investigating whether, under this agreement, Aspen agreed to pay competitors to stay out of the market  in order to protect its position as the sole supplier of fludrocortisone in the UK. The other parties suspected to be parties to the same agreement have not made any admissions. The CMA’s investigation continues in relation to this suspected anti-competitive agreement. \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAspen has agreed to pay a maximum total financial penalty (fine) of £2,101,954 in relation to its admission that it participated in an anti-competitive agreement involving fludrocortisone. This penalty will only become payable when the CMA has completed  that aspect of its investigation and if it finds that the agreement at issue breached the law. The CMA may impose a financial penalty (i.e. a fine) on any business found to have infringed UK or EU competition law. In calculating financial penalties, the CMA takes into account a number of factors including the seriousness of the infringement, turnover in the relevant market and any mitigating or aggravating factors.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe identity of the other parties to  the suspected anti-competitive agreement involving fludrocortisone, which is  still under investigation by the CMA,  will be disclosed if the CMA decides to issue a statement of objections in this case. A statement of objections gives parties notice of a proposed infringement decision under the competition law prohibitions in the Competition Act 1998 and the EU law equivalents. It is a provisional decision and does not necessarily lead to an infringement decision. Aspen has admitted to an infringement of competition law, but the CMA has taken no decision in relation to the subject matter of the investigation at this stage.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d529729ed915d76439bcb90/blister-pack-and-bottle-pills.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d529728ed915d763d12d571/blister-pack-and-bottle-pills.jpg","alt_text":"blister pack and bottle of pills","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-08-13T15:27:57.370Z"}]}}
