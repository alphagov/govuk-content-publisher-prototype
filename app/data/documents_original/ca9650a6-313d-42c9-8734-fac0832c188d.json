available to help you benefit from a simplified approach to certificated family work with cost limits of £25,000.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eProviders are reminded that we are now granting legal aid certificates with a wider limitation on costs for most family proceedings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe made this change in April 2019 and many of you are now benefiting from the new arrangements which are designed to free up administrative time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is because of the reduced need for amendments to the cost limitation to be submitted once the certificate has been granted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-is-this-reminder-needed\"\u003eWhy is this reminder needed?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou need to make applications for a £25,000 cost limit within the Client and Cost Management System (CCMS).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is done by amending the default cost limit when you complete your application in the ‘proceedings and costs’ section of CCMS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not always happening in the way that it should. So, we would like to remind you that guidance is available to help you with the process in the ‘quick guides’ on the CCMS training website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe set number of proceedings this applies to are also outlined on the CCMS website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the process in the way intended means the correct cost limit will be applied to your application first time. So, it will not be held up by the need for us to contact you to check the work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"further-information\"\u003eFurther information\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ccmstraining.justice.gov.uk/news-events-and-resources/news/changes-to-streamline-family-work\"\u003eCCMS website: changes to streamline family work\u003c/a\u003e – family proceedings eligible for simplified application process\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ccmstraining.justice.gov.uk/Quick-guides/Quickguides/making-an-initial-application-1\"\u003eCCMS website: making an initial application\u003c/a\u003e – download ‘£25000 cost limit’ quick guide\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/civil-news-changes-to-streamline-family-work-from-19-april-2019\"\u003eGOV.UK news story\u003c/a\u003e – 18 April announcement of the new simplified process\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"mailto:Digital.Assist@justice.gov.uk\"\u003eDigital.Assist@justice.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e – to email enquiries about CCMS training\u003c/p\u003e\n","change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-07-08T13:46:12.536Z"}]}}
