We registered 180,354 more hectares of land last year, worth £19 billion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLand can serve multiple purposes, for many people, but the owner may not always be clear. That is why, since the first title was created in 1863, there has been \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://hmlandregistry.blog.gov.uk/2019/05/30/registering-land-for-more-than-150-years/\"\u003ean ambition to register the entire land mass of England and Wales\u003c/a\u003e. Today, more than 25.5 million property titles are registered and  we have reached 86.6% registration of England and Wales. In 2018/19 we completed 108,074 first registrations, which equates to 180,354 hectares of land with a value estimated at more than £19 billion. Comprehensive registration is a vital component of meeting the demands of one of the most highly sought-after property markets in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"our-new-single-national-and-digital-way-of-doing-business\"\u003e2. Our new single national and digital way of doing business\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis year we have defined what our new operation looks like. We know the resources it needs and the functional teams it will comprise. We understand the expertise we will need to maintain the integrity of the Land Register. With all the planning complete \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://hmlandregistry.blog.gov.uk/2019/06/04/how-our-award-winning-system-is-speeding-up-casework/\"\u003ewe are now building the operations function of tomorrow\u003c/a\u003e, enabling us to be an expert and resilient organisation that can cope with fluctuations in demand while still delivering a consistently high-quality service to our customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"we-launched-a-new-register\"\u003e3. We launched a new register\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur Local Land Charges (LLC) service went live in July 2018, providing customers with live LLC searches as part of the conveyancing process, simplifying the home buying process. Since Warwick District Council became the first local authority to transfer its data to the new register, we have \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://hmlandregistry.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/11/first-anniversary-of-the-digital-local-land-charges-register/\"\u003ebrought a further five on board\u003c/a\u003e.

The digital service enables a paperless end-to-end remortgage application and approval process. Eighteen mortgage lenders including Nationwide, HSBC, NatWest and Santander have signed up. Our work reflects the increasing use of digital signatures and online mortgage applications in the mortgage market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"we-used-blockchain-to-simulate-the-first-digital-transfer-of-a-property-in-the-uk\"\u003e5. We used blockchain to simulate the first digital transfer of a property in the UK\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis year, our ground-breaking research and development project Digital Street successfully simulated the digital transfer of a real property, utilising \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://hmlandregistry.blog.gov.uk/2019/05/24/could-blockchain-be-the-future-of-the-property-market/\"\u003eblockchain\u003c/a\u003e. The prototype ran a real transfer of a semi-detached house in Gillingham, Kent, alongside the conventional paper-based process, to demonstrate a digital transfer. We worked in parallel with the buyer, seller, conveyancers and bank to simulate the exact transfer digitally. We then used blockchain technology to record the transfer securely. We proudly presented our work at the World Bank conference, securing the interest of other land registries who are experimenting with blockchain projects to work with us to find the best use for the new technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"our-data-continues-to-fuel-the-growing-digital-economy\"\u003e6.

Our joint initiative with Ordnance Survey continues to drive and encourage innovation and collaboration, utilising our combined location and property data. Since October 2017, we have invested £160,000 of grant funding in 14 PropTech companies who have raised more than £6m of third-party investment.

We want every colleague to feel valued and respected for who they are and how they can contribute to our hugely responsible and ambitious task. We want a diverse workforce with an inclusive culture that has a strong sense of shared values. This year we replaced our recruitment and selection processes with a more open, fairer and inclusive approach which places emphasis on the candidate fit with the role, based on a holistic view of their experience, skills, behaviours and strengths. With career and training paths across all key professions, running from entry level through to senior management, we are attracting and nurturing some of the best talent across the public and private sectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"wearehmlr\"\u003e9. #WeAreHMLR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur colleagues’ voices have been heard and a healthy dialogue has flourished with the Chief Executive and other senior leaders.
