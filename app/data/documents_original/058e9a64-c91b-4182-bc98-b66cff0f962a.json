CMA has ordered Tobii to sell Smartbox after finding their completed merger could lead to a reduction in the range of products available and higher prices.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eIn its final report, published today, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) finds that the deal raises significant competition concerns in the supply of augmentative and assistive communication solutions, where Tobii and Smartbox are 2 of the UKâ€™s leading suppliers and compete closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe technologies supplied by Tobii and Smartbox help people with complex speech and language needs to communicate using specialised software and devices, such as joysticks, eye gaze cameras and speech-generating systems. These solutions are typically bought on behalf of those who need them by the NHS, charities and schools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing an in-depth Phase 2 investigation, a group of independent CMA panel members concluded that the loss of competition brought about by the deal could lead to reductions in the existing product range and quality, less new product development and higher prices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CMA has decided that the only effective way of addressing the loss of competition resulting from the merger is for Tobii to sell Smartbox to a new owner, which must be approved by the CMA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eKip Meek, Chair of the independent inquiry group carrying out the investigation, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eCompetition plays a key role in driving improvements in product range and quality â€“ making a real difference for the people who use these technologies to communicate. Competitive pricing also helps to make sure that public bodies arenâ€™t paying more than they should for these technologies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eOur investigation concluded that the loss in competition brought about by this deal could therefore have very serious effects â€“ less choice, less product development and higher prices. Having carefully considered all options, we decided that only selling the entire Smartbox business would effectively address the concerns we found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurther details are available on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/tobii-ab-smartbox-assistive-technology-limited-and-sensory-software-international-ltd-merger-inquiry\"\u003eTobii / Smartbox case page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_3c14b55f-b630-4089-85e9-62503358857c\" class=\"contact\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003eMedia enquiries\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"email\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eEmail\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003ca href=\"mailto:press@cma.gov.uk\" class=\"email\"\u003epress@cma.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003ePress office\u003c/span\u003e\n          020 3738 6460\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eOut-of-hours mobile (for urgent media requests only) \u003c/span\u003e\n          07774 134814\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003cp class=\"comments\"\u003eDuring working hours, please contact the main press office number.
