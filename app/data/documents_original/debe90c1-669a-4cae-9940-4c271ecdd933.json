Agency teams continue to work around the clock to protect people and properties from flooding but, as the flood risk reduces, the focus is increasingly moving to assisting the recovery of affected communities.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eTeams have been continuing to pump floodwater out of affected areas and all properties in Fishlake are now free of flood water. Our staff are now working with local authorities to support community recovery. More than 22,000 properties have been protected from flooding thanks to Environment Agency flood schemes and warnings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnvironment Agency engineers are also  inspecting flood defences for sign of any damage during the flooding and repairing any damage. Specialist teams are flying aeroplanes with ‘LIDAR’ (light detection and ranging) technology to scan and map the affected areas. These surveys allow staff to identify the impact on defences before carrying out manual inspections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the flood risk is reducing across most of the country, with so much water remaining in river catchments, rivers are expected to respond quickly to any future rainfall. There may be ongoing minor river flooding impacts into tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eClare Dinnis, Flood Duty Manager at the Environment Agency said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Despite an improving picture, recent heavy rainfall means that minor river flooding is expected to continue today (Tuesday) in South Yorkshire, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. Minor impacts are also possible in parts of Hull and East Yorkshire today and tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Our field teams are working around the clock to inspect and – where necessary – repair defences.  Since early November our flood defences have helped to protect over 22,000 properties from flooding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We are working closely with local authorities and partners to help communities get back on their feet.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Our thoughts remain with everyone who has been affected by the recent flooding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“People should check their flood risk, sign up for free flood warnings and keep up to date with the latest situation at \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/check-flood-risk\"\u003ehttps://www.gov.uk/check-flood-risk\u003c/a\u003e, call Floodline on 0345 988 1188 or follow @EnvAgency on Twitter for the latest flood updates.”‎\u003c/p\u003e\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dd2c200ed915d08a275f323/img_2463.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dd2c1ff40f0b606ebfea93f/img_2463.jpg","alt_text":"An Environment Agency officer operating a water pump next to a road with an EA vehicle parked nearby","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-11-18T16:08:32.494Z"},{"note":"Updating information on flood response","public_timestamp":"2019-11-19T15:19:52.123Z"}]}}
