Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is holding a major conference in Edinburgh exploring the challenges faced by consumers and how best to tackle them.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThe conference is the first of its kind to be hosted by the CMA’s Edinburgh office and will enable the organisation to better identify and resolve consumer protection issues affecting people in Scotland. It’s also the first time Andrew Tyrie will be speaking in Scotland as Chairman of the CMA. He will use his speech to highlight the benefits of the CMA’s decision to significantly expand its Edinburgh office. The CMA will soon have space to accommodate 100 people – around 10% of its workforce. This will enable it to operate on major competition and consumer cases on behalf of the UK from Edinburgh. He will also set out some of the ways in which the CMA’s work is already benefiting Scotland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eScottish Government Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, Jamie Hepburn, will also be speaking about ensuring the consumer voice in Scotland is heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe event follows major fuel company Certas confirming in discussions with the CMA and publicly this year that it will not enter into potentially exclusive contracts with petrol stations - a voluntary continuation of a guarantee it had previously made to the CMA. This means that drivers on the Western Isles will continue to benefit from the CMA’s action to foster greater competition, helping to keep fuel prices competitive and ensuring people understand the price they are going to pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTopics being discussed at the event in Scotland today include how regulators can best protect vulnerable consumers; the growth and power of digital platforms; and the opportunities presented by Open Banking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCMA Chairman Andrew Tyrie, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWith our decision to expand greatly our office in Edinburgh, we have gone, in 18 months, from a team of 3 to a team of 50 people. And we are taking space to accommodate 100 people. This means that a great deal of CMA work that matters most to Scotland will now be done from Edinburgh. But we have decided to go much further. We want Edinburgh to look after more of the UK’s interests. And we are already running UK-wide cases from Scotland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"notes-to-editors\"\u003eNotes to editors:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe CMA board met in Edinburgh on 25 September. Minutes will be published on the CMA website.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe CMA is continuing to increase its body of work in Scotland to ensure that consumers are protected. In June this year, for example, it launched research into Scottish legal services to determine whether there is a lack of competition among legal service providers in Scotland and what this could mean for customers.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eBeyond these specific Scottish projects, people across the UK are benefiting from the CMA’s work. In August this year, for example, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-pharma-probe-secures-8m-for-the-nhs\"\u003eCMA secured £8 million for the NHS\u003c/a\u003e, which included a £800K share for the NHS in Scotland, as part of its investigation into drug firm Aspen for suspected anti-competitive arrangements. It also \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-blocks-merger-between-sainsburys-and-asda\"\u003eblocked the merger of Sainsbury’s and Asda\u003c/a\u003e after finding the deal would lead to higher prices, less choice, and poorer quality for shoppers.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe CMA is the UK’s primary competition and consumer authority. It is an independent non-ministerial department of the UK government with responsibility for carrying out investigations into mergers, markets and the regulated industries, and enforcing competition and consumer law.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eMedia queries should be sent to \u003ca href=\"mailto:press@cma.gov.uk\"\u003epress@cma.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e or journalists can call 020 3738 6460.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_3c14b55f-b630-4089-85e9-62503358857c\" class=\"contact\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003eMedia enquiries\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"email\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eEmail\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003ca href=\"mailto:press@cma.gov.uk\" class=\"email\"\u003epress@cma.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003ePress office\u003c/span\u003e\n          020 3738 6460\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eOut-of-hours mobile (for urgent media requests only) \u003c/span\u003e\n          07774 134814\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003cp class=\"comments\"\u003eDuring working hours, please contact the main press office number.
