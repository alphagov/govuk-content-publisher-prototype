magistracy, to current incumbents and potential applicants, will focus on ensuring that magistrates roles are rewarding and meaningful. In order to attract more new applicants, the Ministry of Justice will work closely with the magistracy to develop a new recruitment strategy that aims to streamline the process and encourage greater diversity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe move follows a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to-justice-select-committee-report-magistracy\"\u003ereport by the Justice Select Committee\u003c/a\u003e recommending a series of measures designed to make working as a magistrate more appealing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government has worked since 2015 to increase recruitment of magistrates. According to a survey carried out by the Judicial Office in 2017, 80% of respondents said they had a strong feeling of satisfaction with their role; 89% said they had a strong personal attachment to the role; and 91% said they would recommend the role to friends or colleagues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDiversity has also improved. The most recent statistics, published in July 2019, show that 12% of magistrates declared themselves as being from a BAME background - an increase of four percentage points since 2012 - and 56% of magistrates were female - an increase of five percentage points since 2012.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Secretary \u0026amp; Lord Chancellor Rt Hon Robert Buckland QC MP said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eMore than 1,000 new magistrates were recruited in 2018 alone but we are aware there is more to be done.
