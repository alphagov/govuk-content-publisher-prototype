ex-offenders stable accommodation to help them rebuild their lives and stay away from crime is now up and running, Prisons Minister Lucy Frazer announced today (10 October 2019).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrisoners due for release from Leeds, Pentonville and Bristol jails, but who are at risk of homelessness, have been the first to benefit from the trailblazing £6.4 million pilot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe scheme is funded by the MHCLG’s £100 million Rough Sleeping strategy. The most recent national figures, from the Official 2018 Rough Sleeping Snapshot, showed that the number of people sleeping on our streets on a single night fell for the first time in 8 years. The number of those sleeping rough on one night in 2018 was 2% lower than the previous year. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first set of ex-offenders have now entered dedicated accommodation, bringing stability to their often-chaotic lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEx-offenders in the scheme will live in the accommodation for up to 2 years, having received tailored support in the lead up to their release date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResearch shows that former prisoners who are in stable accommodation are significantly less likely to reoffend within a year than those who are homeless or in temporary accommodation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilots are part of a new partnership between prisons, local authorities, probation staff and charities, designed to give prisoners support and stability to turn their lives around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis builds on the government’s recently announced £2.5 billion investment to transform the estate – providing 10,000 modern prison places that will aid rehabilitation and cut reoffending. A further £100 million will be spent on security measures to clamp down on the drugs that hinder rehabilitation, while also fuelling debt, violence and self-harm behind bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrisons Minister Lucy Frazer QC MP said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eThis is a vital part of our plan to reduce reoffending, drive down crime and better protect the public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThe government is investing in prisons that will boost rehabilitation, but we must also make sure that ex-offenders have the stable accommodation that makes them far less likely to commit further crime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWith 20,000 more police officers on the streets and tougher sentences for the most violent and sexual offenders, this is just another way in which we will make our communities safer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHomelessness Minister Luke Hall MP said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eNo one should ever have to live without a home or a roof over their head.
