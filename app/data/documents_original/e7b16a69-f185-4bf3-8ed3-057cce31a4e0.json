CMA has secured the disqualification of 2 former directors of CPM Group Ltd following CPM’s admission that it breached competition law.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThe move follows the Competition and Market Authority’s (\u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e) \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/two-construction-firms-admit-to-illegal-cartel\"\u003estatement of objections\u003c/a\u003e issued on 13 December 2018, alleging that 3 suppliers of pre-cast concrete drainage products – CPM Group Ltd (CPM), Stanton Bonna Ltd, and FP McCann Ltd – breached competition law by taking part in a secret cartel for almost 7 years from 2006. The \u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e has provisionally found that the cartel aimed to fix or coordinate prices and share out the market for certain pre-cast concrete drainage products in Great Britain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of a settlement process, Somerset-based CPM and Derbyshire-based Stanton Bonna Ltd admitted to participating in the alleged cartel and have agreed to pay fines, which will be determined at the end of the \u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e’s investigation. The \u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e’s investigation into a third company which has not entered into settlement, FP McCann Ltd, continues and no assumption should be made that it has infringed the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMr Philip Michael Stacey and Mr Robert James Taylor Smillie were directors at CPM throughout the period of the alleged cartel activity, during which time the company was one of the leading players in the market. The \u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e has secured legally binding undertakings from these former directors, which disqualify them as directors and prevent them from being involved in the management of any company based in England, Scotland and Wales. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMr Stacey has been disqualified for 7 years and 6 months, and Mr Smillie has been disqualified for 6 years and 6 months. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the Company Directors Disqualification Act, the \u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e has the power to apply to the court to disqualify a director from holding company directorships or performing certain roles in relation to a company for a specified period, if a company which he or she is a director of has breached competition law. The Act also allows the \u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e to accept a disqualification undertaking from a director instead of bringing proceedings, which has the same legal effect as a disqualification order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInvestigations are ongoing with respect to other directors and FP McCann Ltd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information, view the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/supply-of-precast-concrete-drainage-products-director-disqualification\"\u003ecase page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5cc1b5fe40f0b640357127ba/concrete-pipes.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5cc1b5feed915d056a432573/concrete-pipes.jpg","alt_text":"concrete pipes","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-04-26T08:11:02.646Z"}]}}
