made the situation better and the YOI is running a normal regime\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eYoung people already getting more time out of cells and in education\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ministry of Justice has today (21 August 2019) announced plans to address the serious issues identified at HMYOI Feltham A, including extra staff training and limiting the population until significant improvements are made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe action plan responds to the Urgent Notification issued by the Prisons Inspectorate last month and details improvements to be made to safety, staff, education and living conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the immediate changes, such as a specialist team working one-to-one with offenders in the prison, have already improved the situation and young people are now getting more time out of cells and in education, and a normal regime is running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere have also been major changes to staff, including the appointment of a new Head of Safeguarding and the short-term secondment of Mike Woodbine, an experienced Deputy Governor from HMYOI Cookham Wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWoodbine was deputy governor at Medway Secure Training Centre after it was brought into public ownership from G4S, and has worked for the Youth Justice Board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy November, the prison hopes to have recruited a trauma expert to help staff better understand some of the reasons driving challenging behaviour at the prison, such as young people who have experienced domestic abuse or sexual violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSignificant refurbishments have already begun - broken cell bells have been repaired, shower facilities improved and the first steps taken towards installing telephones in all cells by next summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWork has also been undertaken to prepare young people for their transition back into the community, by prioritising family contact and working to help local authorities implement a scheme which will identify suitable accommodation one month before release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSecretary of State for Justice, Robert Buckland QC MP, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eWe are urgently making the improvements Feltham A desperately needs – and starting to see results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThese efforts will not be allowed to slow and I am working closely with the prison to change the culture and make Feltham A somewhere that young people can get the support and structure they need to turn their lives around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMinisters set up the Urgent Notification protocol in 2017 to ensure that immediate steps are taken to address serious concerns identified by inspectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Secretary of State’s letter \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/urgent-notification-for-hmyoi-feltham-a\"\u003eresponse and action plan\u003c/a\u003e can be found on GOV.UK. It also sets out how Feltham’s progress over the coming year will be regularly monitored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe final inspection report for HMPYOI Feltham A will be published by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons around 3 months after the inspection. A long-term action plan responding to all recommendations in the HMIP report will also be published.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLast week the Prime Minister announced plans for an extra £100 million to be invested across the prisons estate to boost security and safety so we can protect staff, cut violence, and rehabilitate offenders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government will also be investing up to £2.5 billion in an extra 10,000 prison places.\u003c/p\u003e\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d5d19b7e5274a0769d55767/prisonbars.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d5d19b6ed915d08d3325c57/prisonbars.jpg","alt_text":"Prison bars","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-08-21T12:56:06.683Z"}]}}
