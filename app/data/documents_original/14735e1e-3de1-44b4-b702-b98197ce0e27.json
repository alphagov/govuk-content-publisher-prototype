councils for all the work they have already done, but said they must step up vital preparations and committed £20 million for councils across England to prepare for delivering Brexit on 31 October, whatever the circumstances.   \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe has asked each council to designate a Brexit lead to work with central government and oversee teams in every community who will work with stakeholders in their area to plan intensively for Brexit.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new funding comes in recognition of the central role councils will play to make sure their residents are ready for Brexit, and is expected to support a range of activity including communications, training and the recruitment of staff. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMr Jenrick will continue to talk to

every community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eAnd to do this successfully I have asked every council to appoint a Brexit lead to work with government. We’ll be providing £20 million for councils to support the major step up in preparations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eI want all of us – central and local government – to be fully prepared for leaving the EU on 31 October whatever the circumstances.
