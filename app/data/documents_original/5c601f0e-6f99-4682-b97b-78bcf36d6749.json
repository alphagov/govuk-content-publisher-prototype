fish including sea trout could soon reach previously inaccessible stretches of the River Stour in Dorset.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eThis follows the successful completion of the first phase of a fish passage and habitat improvement scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe project has been delivered by the Environment Agency in partnership with the Wessex Chalkstream Rivers Trust, Bryanston School and local landowners and funded through the Fisheries Improvement Programme which comes directly from national rod licence sales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe scheme, carried out in the grounds of Bryanston School at Blandford Forum, will enable fish to bypass a large weir that previously prevented their passage upstream. Contractors adjusted disused hatches on a bypass channel to improve flows down a redundant stream. A notch was then cut in a disused cast iron weir to make it easier for fish to swim upstream. Finally, a number of woody habitat features were installed to improve habitat for fish and invertebrates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image embedded\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5db9a763ed915d1d05dfb7c5/stour_notch.jpg\" alt=\"The River Stour, flowing over a small weir that has had a notch cut out of it to help fish migrate upstream\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe notch cut in the weir to aid fish passage\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough not a chalk stream, the Stour is an important river rich in wildlife that is fed by several chalk-fed tributaries. It is home to numerous species of insects, animals and fish. Otters are regularly sighted on the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLuke Kozak, a spokesperson for the Environment Agency. said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWeâ€™re really pleased with the outcome of this project that has improved 300m of channel habitat and created fish passage for multiple species of fish. The improvements mean fish can bypass the 1.8m high Deer Park weir which prevents their passage upstream on the main river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSubject to funding, the Environment Agency and its partners plan to carry out the second phase of the project next year. This will involve the reintroduction of gravel to the bypass channel to create fish spawning beds.\u003c/p\u003e\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5db9a6f840f0b637a43d1d4d/stour.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5db9a6f740f0b6379854709d/stour.jpg","alt_text":"Two fisheries officers wading in the River Stour surveying the river for fish","caption":"Fisheries officers survey the River Stour","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-10-30T15:08:29.786Z"}]}}
