live training exercise to help prepare people for flood incidents and other emergencies is being held in the Calder Valley","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eEight flood warning sirens will be sounded across the Upper Calder Valley as part of the live training exercise ‘Operation Calderdale19’ next month (October).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey will be put to the test between 10 and 11am, on Thursday 3 October, in Walsden, Todmorden, Hebden Bridge and Mytholmroyd, to help make sure communities are as prepared as possible for any risk of flooding this winter. Each siren test will last for two minutes. Residents and businesses in the towns do not need to take any action when hearing the sirens at these times. Loud hailer vehicles will be used to alert people to the tests, ahead of the sirens being sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis test will be part of the sixth major emergency exercise held by Calderdale Council, the Environment Agency, emergency services, flood wardens and partners since the floods of Boxing Day 2015. The aim of the exercise is to rehearse the actions that these organisations would take during and after a flood, to ensure the best possible preparation for any future incidents. Flood hubs from Todmorden to Brighouse will be open to practice their processes and sharing information in the event of a flood so they are ready to help affected communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOfficers from the Environment Agency’s flood resilience team will be testing the audibility of the sirens and for the first time this year they will be involving children and parents from a local school in the preparations to help raise their awareness of the risk of flooding at  an early age and how best to be prepared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePupils from Todmorden CE School will be taking part in flood awareness activities in the morning, audibility testing and visiting residents and business owners to help them prepare and keep safe during flood events by having a flood plan, checking the weather forecasts and signing up for flood warnings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMembers of the team will be holding a special assembly and using learning resources in the school to promote understanding of how to receive warnings and what actions to take during a flood incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe sirens are used to warn people that rivers are expected to flood and their audibility level should be similar to that used by emergency vehicles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are four sirens in Todmorden which are sited at the fire station, the high school, Morrisons and Warmans. There is also one at Walsden, two in Hebden Bridge, one in Mytholmroyd and a community siren in Sowerby Bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn Jarvis, flood resilience officer with the Environment Agency, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eIt is important that we test the audibility of sirens to check that they can be heard where they’re supposed to.
