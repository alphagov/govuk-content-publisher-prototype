have both mental ill health and drug and alcohol dependency needs - who are currently experiencing, or at risk of returning to, rough sleeping. Learnings from these projects will help to inform national policy and local commissioning of health and support services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe funding has been awarded to projects based in Lambeth, Newcastle, Westminster, West Sussex, Portsmouth and Leeds.

In Lambeth and Leeds, specialist teams will work on the street to support and co-ordinate the care of those experiencing rough sleeping. Portsmouth, Westminster and Newcastle projects include placing nurses and other specialist staff, such as care coordinators, in homelessness services to provide wrap around and intensive support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll projects have been informed by people who have lived experience of rough sleeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePeople who experience rough sleeping have much poorer health than the general population.
