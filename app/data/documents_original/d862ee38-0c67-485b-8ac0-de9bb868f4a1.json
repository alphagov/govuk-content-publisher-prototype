on a set date. This is assessed by the Valuation Office Agency in England, independently of the government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevaluation is the review of the rateable values of all business and other non-domestic property in England at a particular point in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Autumn Budget 2018 saw business rates relief cut small retailers’ bills by a third, part of over £13 billion of business rates support from the government since 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn response to recommendations from the independent expert panel, led by Sir John Timpson, the government has recently launched a £675 million Future High Streets Fund to help improve infrastructure and access to high streets, put historic buildings back to use and make town centres fit for the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government completed a fundamental review of business rates in 2016, and respondents agreed that property-based taxes were stable, easy to collect, and difficult to avoid. While alternative taxes were proposed, there was no consensus on these, and respondents were clear that such alternatives were not without their own issues. The government has therefore maintained business rates as a property tax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK is separately introducing a UK Digital Services Tax. This will be a narrowly-targeted tax on the UK-generated revenues of specific digital platform business models to ensure that they pay their fair share towards supporting our public services.
