flood defence project will take centre stage at event in France","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eA multi award winning flood defence project will take centre stage at an international showcase event being held in La Rochelle, South West France.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe flood alleviation work delivered at Greatham Creek located in the River Tees estuary between Hartlepool and Billingham has been chosen as an example of ‘Best Practice’ to be presented by representatives from the Environment Agency at \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ice.org.uk\"\u003eICE Coastal Management 2019\u003c/a\u003e (Institution of Civil Engineers / 24 to 26 September).        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGreatham Creek is no stranger to plaudits as the scheme has won or been nominated for a string of national and international industry awards including winning the Institution of Civil Engineers North East Robert Stephenson Award in the large projects category.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Environment Agency worked in partnership with local businesses and organisations including SABIC, INOVYN ChlorVinyls, Wilton Engineering, the RSPB, Natural England and the Teesside Environmental Trust to help reduce the risk of flooding to 350 homes and 32 businesses in Port Clarence and the Seal Sands Industrial Complex.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe scheme has improved the environment by creating almost 50 hectares of new habitat that has benefited a variety of species from the local wildlife population including birds and seals. The sheer size of the additional habitat is the equivalent of 80 football pitches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe need for change was accelerated by the East Coast tidal surge back in 2013 that not only flooded local residential properties but saw the evacuation of some local people.  The tidal surge also had a big impact on the surrounding business community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePhase 1 involved the introduction of flood walls and embankments along the River Tees with Phase 2 dealing with the risk to properties in Port Clarence from Greatham Creek.  The work has included the creation of six kilometres of flood defences to protect the local area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe scheme included the innovative design of seal and bird hides by School of Architecture students at Leeds Beckett University.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDennis Hancock, Catchment Engineer, North East, Environment Agency, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eThe project has seen the successful fusion of innovative engineering and environmental working that combined to create a scheme aimed at helping better protect properties and businesses from potential extreme weather conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThe skills, knowledge and expertise given by all of the regional partners involved has been second to none, and being able to work with the architects and designers of tomorrow has given the Greatham Creek project a fresh approach to help the delivery of a programme that benefits people, wildlife and the local economy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eAll of the hard work and ambition for the scheme is best represented by its selection for the ICE Coastal Management event showing that Greatham Creek is deemed worthy of international recognition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDaren Smith, SABIC’s Site Director, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eThe scheme has been critical to keep the community safe whilst protecting industry and jobs and safeguarding the future of the natural habitat in the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eSABIC are proud to have supported this vital project, it has been a true partnership approach.  The project was very well thought out, containing some fascinating elements and has even been built to take climate change in to account for the future.  The recent awards and nominations for the project are very well deserved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMr Smith concludes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eOur hopes for the project are that the natural habitat continues to attract and help wildlife to flourish alongside providing protection and stability for the surrounding community and industry.
