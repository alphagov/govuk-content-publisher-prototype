passengers travelling between Norwich and Ely will benefit from their fares being capped following a CMA investigation.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eEarlier this year, Abellio was awarded the East Midlands rail franchise by the Department of Transport. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) subsequently reviewed whether any competition issues arose from this award as part of its mergers work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/abellio-east-midlands-limited-east-midlands-rail-franchise\"\u003einvestigation\u003c/a\u003e identified competition concerns on the Norwich and Ely and Thetford and Ely routes, as Abellio would operate both East Midlands Trains and Greater Anglia, and so provide the only services on this line. The CMA was concerned this could reduce competition, as passengers would have no other rail options, which could lead to higher fares. The CMA has found no competition concerns on the other routes  Abellio would operate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter careful consideration, the CMA has now accepted proposals from Abellio, called Undertakings in Lieu, to overcome its concerns. These measures include inflation-linked fare caps on advance fares on the Norwich to Ely route, and on all unregulated fares on the Thetford to Ely route. The operators have also agreed to maintain the availability of advance fares on both routes at existing levels. They will be required to submit regular reports to the CMA to show they are complying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eColin Raftery, Senior Director of Mergers at the CMA, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eThousands of people use this route, so it’s vital they don’t lose out due to reduced competition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWe’ve thoroughly examined Abellio’s proposals to make sure they address all of our concerns, and believe these price caps will protect passengers from potentially facing higher fares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese measures mean the award of the franchise is able to go ahead without a more in-depth merger investigation, referred to as a ‘Phase 2’ investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll information relating to this case can be found on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/abellio-east-midlands-limited-east-midlands-rail-franchise\"\u003eAbellio East Midlands Limited / East Midlands rail franchise page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_3c14b55f-b630-4089-85e9-62503358857c\" class=\"contact\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003eMedia enquiries\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"email\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eEmail\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003ca href=\"mailto:press@cma.gov.uk\" class=\"email\"\u003epress@cma.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003ePress office\u003c/span\u003e\n          020 3738 6460\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eOut-of-hours mobile (for urgent media requests only) \u003c/span\u003e\n          07774 134814\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003cp class=\"comments\"\u003eDuring working hours, please contact the main press office number.
