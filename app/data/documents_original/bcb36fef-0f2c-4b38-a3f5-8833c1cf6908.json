standard for new build homes will bring an environmental revolution to home building – tackling climate change while keeping household bills low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnveiled by the Housing Secretary, Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP, the Future Homes Standard will see polluting fossil fuel heating systems such as gas boilers banned from new homes by 2025 and replaced with the latest generation of clean technology – such as air source heat pumps and cutting-edge solar panels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMinisters will also consult on a new blueprint to overhaul the planning system in order to create a simpler, fairer system that works for everyone – from home owners to small and medium businesses, local communities to housing developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government has also announced plans for a new national design code that will ensure developers build beautiful, well designed homes that people are proud to live in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the coming months, every single local authority across the country will be expected to produce their own design guide which reflects their unique setting, character and history, while meeting the expected national standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHousing Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eBuilding new homes isn’t just about bricks and mortar, I want to ensure everyone – including developers – do their bit to protect the environment and give the next generation beautiful, environmentally friendly homes that local communities can support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThat’s why I am requiring carbon emissions are cut by up to 80% from 2025 for all new homes and have published a National Design Guide, setting out simply what we expect from new development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWe are also reforming the planning system making it faster and more efficient for everyone, from households to large developers, alongside giving families greater freedom to extend their homes to meet their changing needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003ch2

building regulations that will pave the way for the Future Homes Standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 2020 changes aim to improve the environment by cutting carbon emissions in new homes by almost a third, while keeping bills low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsing new technologies such as air source heat pumps and the latest generation of solar panels, developers will need to ensure they are doing their bit to tackle the threat of climate change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eViews are being sought on how changes to building regulations can drive down the carbon footprint of homes built after 2025 – including changes to the ventilation and efficiency requirements as well as the role of councils in getting the best energy standards from developers. The consultation will run until January 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHomeowners could potentially save on their energy bills as developments in the fabric of buildings, such as wall insulation and heating, help drive down the cost of keeping homes warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"accelerated-planning-green-paper\"\u003eAccelerated planning green paper\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government has also confirmed proposals to speed up the planning system, including the potential for more fees to be refunded if councils take too long to decide on specific planning applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe move will benefit all planning applicants, from housing developers to individual householders seeking to extend or modify their own home, as it ensures councils work at pace to decide proposals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal residents will no longer have to contend with a complicated and outdated planning system, but a more user-friendly approach designed to simply the process. Small developers will similarly benefit from the simplification of guidance, with the introduction of a new tiered planning system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApplication fees will also be reviewed to ensure council planning departments are properly resourced, providing more qualified planners to process applications for new homes and other proposals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe accelerated planning green paper will be published in November 2019.
