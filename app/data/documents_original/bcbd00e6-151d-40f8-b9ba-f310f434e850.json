are helping house builders and communities all over the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK PropTech sector, a growing industry potentially worth £6 billion in the UK, is leading the world in the property building and buying market and the sector already receives 10% of global PropTech investment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRoundtable participants

Spacemaker AI, a Norway-based start-up, secured $25 million in Series A funding in June 2019, which included participation from UK real estate technology fund, Round Hill Ventures, who will attend the roundtable event today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"further-information\"\u003eFurther information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will be opening up data about Compulsory Purchase Orders (CPOs) to make this important process more transparent. When used appropriately, CPOs are a valuable tool for local planning authorities to use to deliver housing and regeneration and have been used successfully by local planning authorities across the country since 2004. For example, a large proportion of Birmingham’s regeneration has been delivered via CPOs in the past 15 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBrownfield Land Registers aim to provide up-to-date and consistent information on potential brownfield sites that local authorities consider to be appropriate for residential development. We are simplifying and improving the quality of Brownfield Land Registers to help developers to find brownfield land to build on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCreating a national index of all brownfield data will be of value to local authorities and housing developers. It will ensure local planning authorities publish brownfield land data in a standardised way nationally. New guidance has been written to support local planning authorities to implement the new standards and a number of tools have been built to help validate the data to meet the standards and make the process of publishing and collecting data easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have recently completed research into which data can most easily be made available from local plans and existing planning systems. Currently, most Local Plan and planning application documentation is issued in a PDF format and specific policy detail is not easy to find and inconsistent across local authorities. A department initiative could deploy a natively digital product to make essential information accessible to policy makers, citizens and digital entrepreneurs in a consistent and standardised format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Geospatial Commission is a government commitment to maximise the value of geospatial data, with £80 million of allocated funding. It will also help the growth of the digital economy and consolidate the UK’s position as the best place to start and grow a digital business. The commission will also demonstrate innovative solutions for identified strategic challenges, and accelerate delivery of economic, social and environmental benefits derived from geospatial data.

Its use can help make possible a wide range of development, regeneration and infrastructure projects, where there is a compelling case in the public interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_c1f13fd8-9feb-4028-9323-7cb3383323b4\" class=\"contact\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003eMedia enquiries\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"email\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eEmail\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003ca href=\"mailto:newsdesk@communities.gov.uk\" class=\"email\"\u003enewsdesk@communities.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003ePlease use this number if you are a journalist wishing to speak to Press Office\u003c/span\u003e\n          0303 444 1209\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_bfc00333-a9ee-4ca1-9d3c-432dbcdf4640\" class=\"contact postal-address\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003eOffice address and general enquiries\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n      \u003cp class=\"adr\"\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"street-address\"\u003e2 Marsham Street\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLondon\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"postal-code\"\u003eSW1P 4DF\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"contact_form_url\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eContact form\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003ca href=\"https://forms.communities.gov.uk/\"\u003ehttps://forms.communit...\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eGeneral enquiries:  please use this number if you are a member of the public\u003c/span\u003e\n          030 3444 0000\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_f375ee5c-c7f3-4e09-9ba8-2ca0308481c5\" class=\"contact\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003ch3\u003eSocial media - MHCLG\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n      \u003cp class=\"comments\"\u003eTwitter - \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mhclg\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/mhclg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFlickr - \u003ca href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mhclg\"\u003ehttp://www.flickr.com/photos/mhclg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLinkedIn - \u003ca href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/company/mhclg\"\u003ehttp://www.linkedin.com/company/mhclg\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","image":{"high_resolution_url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dad681440f0b659831e09a4/land-planning-aerial-1-960.jpg","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dad681440f0b659831e09a3/land-planning-aerial-1-960.jpg","alt_text":"Aerial photograph of land and housing","caption":"","credit":""},"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2019-10-21T12:16:47.145Z"}]}}
