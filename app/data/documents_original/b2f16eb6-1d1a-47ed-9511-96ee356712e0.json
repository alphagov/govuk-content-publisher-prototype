Firms including Europcar and Sixt have made changes to deliver on previous commitments about how they display charges and other key information on their websites, so people will now know exactly how much they are paying upfront.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe move comes after a \u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e review of whether the companies were complying with commitments they made to be clearer about their prices, in some cases about charges that people can’t avoid when renting a car. This found the firms were still providing unclear information on some of their websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2015, Avis Budget, Enterprise, Hertz, Sixt, and Europcar  made a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/car-rental-customers-set-to-drive-off-with-better-deals\"\u003eseries of commitments\u003c/a\u003e to the \u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e, European Commission and other consumer enforcement authorities across Europe. These included providing customers with the total price they will pay at the start of the booking process and clearer information about any other costs, such as excess amounts and deposits. But, after reviewing the firms’ practices, the \u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e found that in some cases customers could still be hit by hidden costs or misled by unclear information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter leading a Europe-wide project to address these concerns, the \u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e is now satisfied that the 5 companies are making the necessary changes to make sure that key information is displayed clearly and prominently. These changes will also apply to Goldcar following its recent acquisition by Europcar, and, as this action has been taken across Europe, consumers across the EU will benefit from \u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e’s work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge Lusty, Senior Director for Consumer Protection at the \u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eNo one should be misled or caught out by hidden fees when renting a car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThe big 5 told us in 2015 they would update their practices, but we’ve found they weren’t doing all that they’d committed to.
