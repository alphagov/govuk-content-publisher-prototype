online support as part of government's commitment to give greater protection to tenants, and reform the private rented sector for the better.","details":{"body":"\u003cp\u003eLocal authorities across the country are set to receive a new package of online support as part of the governmentâ€™s commitment to give greater protection to tenants, and reform the private rented sector for the better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe publication of 2 new guidance documents today (9 April 2019), one for local authority enforcement practitioners and another for tenants and landlords, signals the latest step in the government cracking down on the small minority of criminal landlords who exploit tenants for their own gains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal authority enforcement officers play a crucial role in making sure people in rented accommodation have somewhere safe and secure to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the success of a nationwide programme of workshops rolled out by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government to help enforcement officers learn from one another, the guidance published today ensures those responsible for protecting tenants can use the powers available to them to maximum effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new support includes an easy to navigate digital enforcement package with online learning modules for those officers who were unable to attend the national programme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe guide for tenants and landlords brings together the rights and responsibilities of each, provides links to in depth guidance on legislation and complements previous steps by the government to support those in the private rented sector, including through the \u003ca

the private rented sector will ensure they are fully equipped to make use of any new powers which can improve the lives of tenants trapped in poor quality accommodation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp
