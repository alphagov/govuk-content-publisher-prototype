to over 170,000 – the highest number built over the same period in the last 11 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePublished today (3 October 2019) by government, the figures show a total of 173,660 new homes were built for the year ending June 2019 – representing an 8% increase compared with the previous year alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWelcoming the figures, Housing Secretary Rt Hon

is hugely welcome, with the number of new homes built reaching an 11-year high. We are moving in the right direction, but there is still much more to do if we are going to deliver the numbers needed by communities up and down the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eI’m determined to deliver homes that are high-quality, well designed and good for the planet. Faster and simpler planning regulations will help us reach that goal, which is why I have announced measures to accelerate planning decisions for homes and reduce the use of unnecessary conditions by up to a third, freeing up developers so they can get on and build in a locally appropriate way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe last year also saw the proportion of family houses built increase to 78% of all the new dwellings delivered in the marketplace – the highest the figure has been since 2000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMinisters have this week announced new measures as part of the accelerated planning green paper which will quicken the pace of decision making and get shovels in the ground faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNew permitted development rights, including allowing the demolition and rebuild of old commercial buildings, as well as requiring councils to meet timescales or refund planning application fees are aimed at getting homes built faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday’s data release points to positive news ahead of publication of comprehensive housing delivery statistics in November.
